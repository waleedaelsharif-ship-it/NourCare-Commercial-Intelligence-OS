# Case 09 — Night Shift Operational Risk

---

## Executive Summary

During Ramadan peak hours, dispensing errors and transaction reversals increased by 38% in night shifts. A staffing reallocation and shift-based KPI redesign reduced error exposure, protected 2.6M SAR in potential financial leakage, and stabilized operational reliability.

---

## Context

Quarter: Q1  
Season: Ramadan Peak  
Scope: 32 High-Volume Urban Branches  
Operational Risk: Elevated night shift error rate  

Extended evening operating hours during Ramadan increased workload intensity between 9 PM and 2 AM.

---

## Baseline Financial Spine

Average Daily Transactions (Pre-Ramadan): 4,200  
Average Daily Transactions (Ramadan): 5,600  
Night Shift Share: 48% of total volume  
Error Rate Increase: +38%  
Return & Reversal Loss Exposure: 2.6M SAR projected  
ROIC: 16.1%  

---

## Analytical Diagnosis

- Staffing levels unchanged despite volume increase  
- Junior pharmacists covering peak night hours  
- Limited fatigue control measures  
- Incentive structure focused on speed, not accuracy  

**Root Structural Cause:**  
Operational scaling focused on volume handling rather than risk-adjusted staffing.

---

## Political & Behavioral Layer

Regional managers prioritized throughput speed.  
Senior staff resisted night reassignment.  
HR lacked seasonal shift rebalancing framework.

---

## Executive Decision

Implement risk-weighted staffing model with senior coverage during peak night hours and introduce shift-based accuracy KPI.

---

## Trade-off Matrix

| Strategic Gain | Financial Sacrifice | Risk Created | Net Economic Effect |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| 2.6M SAR loss prevention | 0.9M SAR overtime cost | Temporary morale tension | +1.7M SAR net operational protection |

**Capital Logic:**  
Preventing financial leakage protects gross margin and avoids hidden capital erosion.

---

## Counterfactual Scenario

Without intervention:

- Error-related financial loss increase  
- Reputation risk escalation  
- Regulatory exposure potential  
- Staff burnout acceleration  

---

## Defensibility Test

### CFO Challenge  
Why increase staffing cost during peak margin period?

**Response:**  
Error-related financial leakage exceeds incremental staffing cost. Margin protection requires accuracy investment.

### COO Challenge  
Will senior night coverage disrupt morale?

**Response:**  
Shift rotation policy redesigned to ensure fairness and fatigue balance.

## Execution Reality

- Senior pharmacist coverage increased by 40% during peak hours  
- Error rate reduced to near pre-Ramadan baseline  
- Return losses reduced by 65%  
- Customer satisfaction stabilized  

---

## Financial Impact

Loss Avoided: 2.6M SAR  
Overtime Cost: 0.9M SAR  
Net Operational Protection: +1.7M SAR  
Reputational Risk Mitigated

## Decision Ownership

Decision Owner: Head of Commercial Intelligence  
Operational Lead: Regional Operations Directors  
HR Alignment: Workforce Planning Unit  
Review Cycle: Weekly peak monitoring  

---

## Lessons Learned

1. Volume scaling requires risk scaling.  
2. Fatigue directly impacts financial leakage.  
3. Accuracy is a capital protection lever.  
4. Seasonal operations need dynamic staffing models.  
5. Hidden operational risk erodes margin silently.

## Capital Logic Summary

Strategic staffing adjustment during peak stress protected financial integrity, preserved brand trust, and reinforced operational governance under seasonal pressure.
