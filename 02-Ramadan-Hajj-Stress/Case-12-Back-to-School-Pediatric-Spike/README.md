# Case 12 — Back-to-School Pediatric Spike

---

## Executive Summary

Back-to-school demand increased pediatric category sales by 41% over a 6-week period. A controlled assortment concentration strategy captured demand while preventing 16M SAR in post-season excess inventory and margin erosion.

---

## Context

Quarter: Q3  
Season: Back-to-School (6 weeks)  
Scope: National (48 branches)  
Demand Surge: +41% in pediatric & immunity categories  
Capital at Risk: 16M SAR potential overbuild  

Consumer behavior shifted toward prevention-focused purchases for school children.

---

## Baseline Financial Spine

Pediatric Category Revenue (Baseline): 92M SAR annually  
Seasonal Uplift Projection: +35–45%  
Inventory Value (Category Pre-Season): 14M SAR  
Proposed Inventory Build: +16M SAR  
Inventory Turnover: 6.6  
ROIC: 16.4%  
Cash Conversion Cycle: 65 days

## Visual Insight

![Pediatric Seasonal Demand Curve](Pediatric_Seasonal_Spike.png)

---

## Analytical Diagnosis

- 64% of uplift driven by 11 core SKUs  
- 22% of proposed build allocated to low-velocity variants  
- Historic overhang after season: 18% markdown requirement  
- Promotion intensity inflated supplier forecasts  

**Root Structural Cause:**  
Variant expansion mistaken for volume expansion.

---

## Political & Behavioral Layer

Category managers incentivized on revenue capture.  
Suppliers pushed bundle-based assortment expansion.  
Regional managers feared competitor stockouts.

---

## Executive Decision

Limit expansion to top 15 pediatric SKUs and freeze variant proliferation across low-velocity segments.

---

## Trade-off Matrix

| Strategic Gain | Financial Sacrifice | Risk Created | Net Economic Effect |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| 16M SAR capital protection | 1.1M SAR lost promotional rebate | 2% assortment limitation perception | Structural capital efficiency |

**Capital Logic:**  
Preventing over-assortment protects post-season margin and reduces forced markdown risk.

---

## Counterfactual Scenario

If full build executed:

- Post-season excess: 6–8M SAR  
- Margin compression via markdown  
- Cash cycle deterioration  
- Supplier dependency on promotional depth  

---

## Defensibility Test

### CFO Challenge  
Why not maximize revenue during guaranteed demand?

**Response:**  
Seasonal demand concentration does not justify SKU expansion beyond velocity-driven threshold.

### COO Challenge  
Will limited assortment hurt competitiveness?

**Response:**  
Core SKUs cover 64% of demand concentration. Depth beyond that yields diminishing return.

---

## Execution Reality

- 13M SAR allocated to top-performing SKUs  
- Variant freeze implemented  
- No meaningful stockout in core SKUs  
- Post-season markdown reduced by 52% vs prior year  

---

## Financial Impact

Capital Preserved: 16M SAR  
Markdown Avoided: ~3.2M SAR  
Cash Cycle Maintained  
ROIC Protected Above 16%  

---

## Decision Ownership

Decision Owner: Head of Commercial Intelligence  
Category Lead: Pediatric Category Manager  
Financial Oversight: CFO  
Review Cycle: Pre-Season + 30-Day Post-Season Review  

---

## Lessons Learned

1. Volume spike ≠ assortment expansion.  
2. Variant proliferation erodes post-season margin.  
3. Core SKU concentration protects capital.  
4. Seasonal planning must include exit strategy.  
5. Promotion without discipline creates structural waste.

## Capital Logic Summary

Controlled pediatric expansion captured seasonal revenue while preventing structural capital distortion and post-season markdown erosion.
