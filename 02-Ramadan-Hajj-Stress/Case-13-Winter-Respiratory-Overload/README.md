# Case 13 — Winter Respiratory Overload

---

## Executive Summary

A sharp winter respiratory surge increased demand for cold, flu, and cough medications by 48% within four weeks. A dynamic replenishment prioritization model secured supply continuity while preventing 24M SAR opportunistic overstock under supplier price inflation pressure.

---

## Context

Quarter: Q4  
Season: Winter Respiratory Peak  
Scope: National (48 branches)  
Demand Surge: +48% across respiratory categories  
Capital at Risk: 24M SAR inflated procurement exposure  

Unexpected early cold wave accelerated demand beyond initial forecast.

---

## Baseline Financial Spine

Respiratory Category Revenue (Baseline): 132M SAR annually  
Seasonal Uplift (Expected): +35%  
Actual Uplift: +48%  
Inventory Coverage Pre-Spike: 21 days  
Supplier Price Increase Proposal: +6%  
Inventory Turnover: 6.7  
ROIC: 16.6%

## Visual Insight

---

## Analytical Diagnosis

- 70% of surge concentrated in 9 SKUs  
- Suppliers attempted price escalation during peak demand  
- Panic-buy risk at branch level  
- Forecast model lagged real-time demand by 10 days  

**Root Structural Cause:**  
Static forecast model unable to react to real-time epidemiological shift.

---

## Political & Behavioral Layer

Branch managers escalated emergency orders.  
Suppliers leveraged demand spike to increase price.  
Finance concerned about margin compression.

---

## Executive Decision

Activate real-time demand signal tracking and prioritize replenishment for top 9 SKUs while rejecting supplier price escalation beyond 3%.

---

## Trade-off Matrix

| Strategic Gain | Financial Sacrifice | Risk Created | Net Economic Effect |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| 24M SAR capital exposure avoided | 1.2M SAR missed bulk opportunity | 3% temporary availability pressure | Margin & ROIC protection |

**Capital Logic:**  
Rejecting inflated procurement volumes protects margin integrity and prevents post-season excess.

---

## Counterfactual Scenario

If panic procurement executed:

- Supplier COGS inflation +6%  
- Post-season respiratory overhang  
- Forced markdown compression  
- Cash cycle deterioration  

---

## Defensibility Test

### CFO Challenge  
Why accept any price increase at all?

**Response:**  
Limited 3% concession secured continuity while preserving negotiation leverage and margin integrity.

### COO Challenge  
Will tight replenishment risk stockouts?

**Response:**  
Top 9 SKUs represent 70% of demand concentration. Focused prioritization ensures core coverage.

---

## Execution Reality

- Emergency reallocation within 72 hours  
- 8 high-demand SKUs maintained >95% availability  
- Supplier inflation limited to negotiated cap  
- Post-season markdown reduced vs prior year  

---

## Financial Impact

Capital Exposure Avoided: 24M SAR  
COGS Inflation Limited  
Cash Cycle Stable  
ROIC Maintained Above 16.5%  

---

## Decision Ownership

Decision Owner: Head of Commercial Intelligence  
Operational Lead: Supply Chain Director  
Category Lead: Respiratory Category Manager  
Review Cycle: Weekly demand volatility monitoring  

---

## Lessons Learned

1. Epidemiological shifts require dynamic modeling.  
2. Supplier opportunism must be disciplined.  
3. Concentration logic protects availability.  
4. Panic buying creates post-season waste.  
5. Real-time signals outperform static forecasts.

---

## Capital Logic Summary

Dynamic replenishment discipline protected margin integrity, capital efficiency, and service continuity during winter demand acceleration.
