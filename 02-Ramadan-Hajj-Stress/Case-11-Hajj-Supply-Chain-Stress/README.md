# Case 11 — Hajj Supply Chain Stress

---

## Executive Summary

During Hajj peak week, inbound supply lead times increased by 63% due to congestion and transportation restrictions. A pre-emptive buffer rationalization and DC prioritization strategy prevented 21M SAR emergency overstock and protected national availability.

---

## Context

Quarter: Q3  
Season: Hajj Peak Week  
Regions Impacted: Makkah, Madinah, Taif  
Operational Risk: Lead time extension +63%  
Capital at Risk: 21M SAR emergency procurement escalation  

Transportation congestion and restricted access zones disrupted normal replenishment cycles.

---

## Baseline Financial Spine

National Inventory Value: 176M SAR  
Average Lead Time (Normal): 3.5 days  
Lead Time (Hajj): 5.7 days  
Emergency Procurement Proposal: +21M SAR  
Inventory Turnover: 6.5  
ROIC: 16.3%

## Visual Insight

---

## Analytical Diagnosis

- 68% of demand concentrated in hydration, blister care, and acute OTC  
- Existing DC buffers sufficient for 9 days coverage  
- Emergency procurement priced at +7% premium  
- Historical Hajj spike duration: 8–10 days  

**Root Structural Cause:**  
Lead time shock misinterpreted as structural supply collapse.

---

## Political & Behavioral Layer

Local branch managers escalated shortage fears.  
Suppliers offered premium expedited shipments.  
Logistics teams overwhelmed with congestion.

---

## Executive Decision

Activate pre-positioned DC buffers and prioritize high-velocity SKUs instead of executing premium emergency procurement.

---

## Trade-off Matrix

| Strategic Gain | Financial Sacrifice | Risk Created | Net Economic Effect |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| 21M SAR capital preservation | 0.8M SAR premium logistics handling | 2–3% temporary stockout risk | Structural margin protection |

**Capital Logic:**  
Emergency premium procurement increases COGS and capital exposure without structural benefit.

---

## Counterfactual Scenario

If emergency procurement executed:

- 7% higher COGS  
- Post-Hajj excess inventory risk  
- Cash cycle deterioration  
- Margin compression  

---

## Defensibility Test

### CFO Challenge  
Why not secure premium emergency stock to eliminate risk?

**Response:**  
Premium stock inflates cost and capital simultaneously. Historical demand duration does not justify structural overbuy.

### COO Challenge  
What if DC buffer proves insufficient?

**Response:**  
Buffer stress-tested against 10-day surge model. Daily monitoring enabled rapid micro-adjustment.

---

## Execution Reality

- DC reallocation prioritized 14 core SKUs  
- No national-level stock collapse  
- Temporary 2.8% localized stockout  
- Post-Hajj inventory normalized within 14 days  

---

## Financial Impact

Capital Preserved: 21M SAR  
COGS Inflation Avoided  
Cash Cycle Maintained at 65 days  
ROIC Protected Above 16%  

---

## Decision Ownership

Decision Owner: Head of Commercial Intelligence  
Operational Lead: Supply Chain Director  
Financial Oversight: CFO  
Review Cycle: Event stress audit  

---

## Lessons Learned

1. Lead time shocks require buffer logic, not panic buying.  
2. Premium emergency procurement often destroys margin.  
3. Seasonal congestion must be modeled in advance.  
4. Distribution center buffers are strategic assets.  
5. Capital discipline under stress differentiates resilient systems.

## Capital Logic Summary

Structured buffer deployment during Hajj protected service continuity while preventing structural capital and margin distortion.
