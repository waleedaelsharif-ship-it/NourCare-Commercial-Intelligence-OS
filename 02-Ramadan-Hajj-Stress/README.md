# Cluster 02 — Ramadan & Hajj Stress Simulation

---

## Strategic Intent

This cluster models extreme seasonal volatility, supply pressure, demand spikes, and operational overload across high-intensity periods in Saudi Arabia.

Primary Objective: Preserve service continuity and capital efficiency under seasonal stress.

---

## Seasonal Risk Themes

- Ramadan demand distortion  
- Hajj supply disruption  
- Makkah temporary population surge  
- Night shift error exposure  
- Overload week logistics strain  
- Back-to-school pediatric spike  
- Winter respiratory surge  

---

## Stress Philosophy

Seasonal strength is not measured by revenue growth.

It is measured by:

- Controlled inventory scaling  
- Stable cash conversion cycle  
- Margin protection under promotion intensity  
- Supply continuity without capital overexpansion  

---

## Governance Model

Decision Owner: Head of Commercial Intelligence  
Operational Lead: Regional Operations Directors  
Financial Oversight: CFO  
Seasonal Review Cycle: Pre-Season Simulation + Post-Season Audit  

Escalation Rule:  
If seasonal inventory build exceeds forecasted demand by >7%, intervention is triggered.

## Cases in This Cluster

1. Ramadan Basket Surge
2. Night Shift Operational Risk
3. Makkah Temporary Demand Spike
4. Hajj Supply Chain Stress
5. Back-to-School Pediatric Demand
6. Winter Respiratory Overload
7. Promotional Margin Compression

---

## Strategic Note

Seasonal volatility exposes structural weaknesses faster than stable periods.

This cluster stress-tests the Commercial Intelligence Operating System under peak pressure.
