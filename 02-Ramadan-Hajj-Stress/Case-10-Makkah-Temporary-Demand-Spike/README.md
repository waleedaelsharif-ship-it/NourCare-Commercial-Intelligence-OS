# Case 10 — Makkah Temporary Demand Spike

---

## Executive Summary

A sudden population surge in Makkah during Ramadan’s last ten nights increased branch-level demand by 54% in hydration and emergency OTC categories. A rapid redistribution model protected availability while avoiding 18M SAR unnecessary permanent inventory expansion.

---

## Context

Quarter: Q1  
Season: Ramadan – Final 10 Nights  
Region: Makkah (8 branches)  
Demand Surge: +54% localized spike  
Capital at Risk: 18M SAR emergency inventory build  

Temporary population inflow created extreme demand concentration within a short window.

---

## Baseline Financial Spine

Makkah Monthly Revenue (Baseline): 62M SAR  
Projected Surge Revenue: 95M SAR  
Inventory Coverage (Pre-Spike): 24 days  
Proposed Emergency Build: +18M SAR  
Cash Conversion Cycle (National): 64 days  
ROIC: 16.0%

## Visual Insight

![Localized Demand Surge Curve](Makkah_Surge_Curve.png)

---

## Analytical Diagnosis

- 72% of surge concentrated in 6 emergency & hydration SKUs  
- Spike duration limited to 12 days  
- National inventory buffers sufficient for redistribution  
- Permanent build unnecessary for temporary spike  

**Root Structural Cause:**  
Localized demand misinterpreted as structural growth.

---

## Political & Behavioral Layer

Local managers demanded immediate restocking escalation.  
Suppliers offered fast-delivery premium shipments.  
Finance concerned about post-spike dead stock in Makkah region.

---

## Executive Decision

Activate inter-regional redistribution protocol instead of approving permanent local inventory expansion.

---

## Trade-off Matrix

| Strategic Gain | Financial Sacrifice | Risk Created | Net Economic Effect |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| 18M SAR capital preservation | 0.6M SAR redistribution logistics cost | 2% temporary imbalance risk in other regions | Structural capital protection |

**Capital Logic:**  
Temporary demand does not justify permanent capital allocation. Redistribution cost is materially lower than overstock exposure.

---

## Counterfactual Scenario

If emergency build executed:

- Post-spike excess inventory: +11M SAR  
- Forced markdown exposure  
- Regional capital inefficiency  
- National cash cycle deterioration  

---

## Defensibility Test

### CFO Challenge  
Why not secure immediate stock to maximize surge revenue?

**Response:**  
Demand spike duration is short. Permanent capital expansion creates post-event inefficiency exceeding temporary logistics cost.

### COO Challenge  
Will redistribution delay service?

**Response:**  
Pre-identified buffer branches activated within 48 hours. Surge coverage maintained.

---

## Execution Reality

- 9M SAR redistributed from Riyadh and Jeddah  
- 6M SAR emergency replenishment secured centrally  
- Surge demand met with <3% stockout  
- Post-event inventory normalized within 2 weeks  

---

## Financial Impact

Capital Preserved: 18M SAR  
Logistics Cost: 0.6M SAR  
Revenue Capture Maintained  
Cash Cycle Stable at 64–65 days  
ROIC Protected

## Decision Ownership

Decision Owner: Head of Commercial Intelligence  
Operational Lead: Regional Directors  
Logistics Execution: Distribution Centers  
Review Cycle: Event-based performance audit  

---

## Lessons Learned

1. Temporary demand requires temporary capital.  
2. Redistribution often outperforms emergency build.  
3. Geographic spikes must not distort national inventory strategy.  
4. Surge revenue must be capital-efficient.  
5. Event-based playbooks reduce panic decisions.

## Capital Logic Summary

Localized surge management through redistribution preserved capital discipline while protecting service continuity, reinforcing geographic intelligence under seasonal pressure.
