# Case 08 — Ramadan Basket Surge

---

## Executive Summary

Ramadan demand concentration increased average basket size by 27%, but uncontrolled pre-season stocking risked locking 31M SAR in excess capital. A demand-weighted stocking strategy preserved availability while limiting capital overexpansion.

---

## Context

Quarter: Q1  
Season: Ramadan Peak  
Scope: National (48 branches)  
Demand Spike: +32% in 5 core fasting-related categories  
Capital at Risk: 31M SAR potential overstock  

Ramadan shifted consumption patterns toward hydration, vitamins, digestive aids, and family OTC bundles.

---

## Baseline Financial Spine

Pre-Ramadan Inventory: 172M SAR  
Projected Inventory Build Proposal: +31M SAR  
Historical Ramadan Sales Uplift: +18%  
Forecasted Uplift: +28%  
Inventory Turnover (Pre): 6.4  
ROIC: 16.2%  
Cash Conversion Cycle: 63 days

## Visual Insight

![Ramadan Category Demand Concentration](Ramadan_Demand_Concentration.png)

---

## Analytical Diagnosis

- 5 categories represented 61% of Ramadan uplift  
- 14 secondary categories overestimated by +22%  
- Basket size increased, but SKU depth per category remained stable  
- Historic overstock occurred in non-core Ramadan SKUs  

**Root Structural Cause:**  
Demand spike concentrated in specific mission-driven categories, not broad assortment expansion.

---

## Political & Behavioral Layer

Regional managers demanded broad inventory increase “to avoid embarrassment.”  
Suppliers pushed Ramadan bundles tied to volume commitments.  
Finance warned of post-Ramadan capital freeze risk.

---

## Executive Decision

Approve targeted inventory increase limited to top Ramadan mission categories and cap total capital expansion at 14M SAR instead of proposed 31M SAR.

---

## Trade-off Matrix

| Strategic Gain | Financial Sacrifice | Risk Created | Net Economic Effect |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| Availability secured in 5 core categories | 1.3M SAR forgone bundle rebates | 3% localized stockout risk | +17M SAR capital efficiency protection |

**Capital Logic:**  
Limiting expansion reduced post-Ramadan inventory compression risk while preserving demand capture.

---

## Counterfactual Scenario

If full expansion executed:

- Post-Ramadan dead stock increase: +9M SAR  
- Cash cycle deterioration: +11 days  
- Margin compression via forced markdown  

---

## Defensibility Test

### CFO Challenge  
Why approve any expansion at all?

**Response:**  
Ramadan uplift is real and concentrated. Refusing targeted build risks revenue loss. Controlled expansion protects both revenue and capital.

### COO Challenge  
Why not expand across all categories?

**Response:**  
Demand data shows concentration. Broad expansion historically led to post-season overhang.

---

## Execution Reality

- 12.8M SAR allocated to core Ramadan categories  
- Secondary category expansion frozen  
- Stockout rate maintained under 2.5%  
- Post-Ramadan compression minimal  

---

## Financial Impact

Revenue Capture: +21% vs baseline  
Inventory Expansion Limited to: +14M SAR  
Cash Conversion Cycle Stable at 64 days  
ROIC Maintained Above 16%  

---

## Decision Ownership

Decision Owner: Head of Commercial Intelligence  
Operational Execution: Regional Directors  
Financial Oversight: CFO  
Review Cycle: Pre-Season + Post-Season Audit  

---

## Lessons Learned

1. Ramadan demand is concentrated, not universal.  
2. Basket expansion does not justify assortment inflation.  
3. Seasonal fear leads to capital waste.  
4. Targeted expansion outperforms broad stocking.  
5. Post-season compression must be planned pre-season.

---

## Capital Logic Summary

Targeted Ramadan expansion preserved revenue capture while preventing structural capital overhang, reinforcing seasonal capital discipline.
