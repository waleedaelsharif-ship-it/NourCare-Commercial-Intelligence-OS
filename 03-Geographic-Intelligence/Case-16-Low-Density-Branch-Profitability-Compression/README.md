# Case 16 — Low-Density Branch Profitability Compression

---

## Executive Summary

Low-density semi-urban branches operating under a uniform national inventory and cost structure experienced 2.8% ROIC compression. A branch-tiered capital allocation model restored profitability and reduced 12M SAR inefficient inventory allocation.

---

## Context

Quarter: Q4  
Branch Type: Semi-Urban / Low-Density  
Number of Branches Impacted: 11  
Revenue Contribution: 9% of total network  
ROIC Gap: -2.8% vs national average  

Uniform stocking and staffing assumptions created structural inefficiency.

---

## Baseline Financial Spine

Average Revenue per Urban Branch: 4.2M SAR/month  
Average Revenue per Low-Density Branch: 1.8M SAR/month  
Inventory Coverage (Uniform Policy): 30 days  
Inventory Turnover (Low-Density): 5.1  
National Turnover: 6.8  
Low-Density ROIC: 13.9%  
National ROIC: 16.7%

## Visual Insight

![Branch Tier ROIC Gap](Branch_Tier_ROIC_Gap.png)

---

## Analytical Diagnosis

- SKU overlap 85% identical to urban branches  
- 21% of inventory low-velocity in semi-urban branches  
- Fixed cost ratio higher per revenue SAR  
- Staffing schedule not adjusted to traffic density  

**Root Structural Cause:**  
Uniform operating model applied to heterogeneous demand environments.

---

## Political & Behavioral Layer

Central team feared brand inconsistency from differentiated branch models.  
Regional directors lacked authority to tailor capital allocation.  
Finance observed declining contribution per branch but no tier-based correction.

---

## Executive Decision

Implement branch-tiered inventory and staffing model reducing SKU depth and coverage in low-density locations.

---

## Trade-off Matrix

| Strategic Gain | Financial Sacrifice | Risk Created | Net Economic Effect |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| 12M SAR inventory reduction | 0.6M SAR potential revenue softness | Perceived assortment limitation | +2.8% ROIC recovery |

**Capital Logic:**  
Capital efficiency per branch must align with demand density, not national uniformity.

---

## Counterfactual Scenario

If uniform model maintained:

- Continued ROIC erosion  
- Higher markdown exposure  
- Increased cash cycle drag  
- Expansion capital misallocation  

---

## Defensibility Test

### CFO Challenge  
Why invest time in low-revenue branches?

**Response:**  
Capital inefficiency compounds network-wide. Even 9% revenue share impacts overall ROIC.

### COO Challenge  
Will reduced assortment hurt local competitiveness?

**Response:**  
SKU reduction focused on low-velocity overlap items, preserving core demand coverage.

---

## Execution Reality

- 640 SKUs removed across 11 branches  
- Inventory coverage reduced from 30 → 22 days  
- Staffing schedules optimized  
- Slow-moving ratio reduced by 15%  

---

## Financial Impact

Inventory Reduction: 12M SAR  
Low-Density ROIC: 13.9% → 16.7%  
Cash Conversion Improvement  
Network ROIC Stabilized

## Decision Ownership

Decision Owner: Head of Commercial Intelligence  
Regional Lead: Semi-Urban Operations Director  
Financial Oversight: CFO  
Review Cycle: Quarterly Branch Tier Review  

---

## Lessons Learned

1. Branch density dictates capital allocation logic.  
2. Uniformity creates structural inefficiency.  
3. Small branches require lean inventory architecture.  
4. Contribution per branch matters more than revenue per branch.  
5. Tiered governance strengthens network resilience.

## Capital Logic Summary

Branch-tiered capital allocation restored profitability by aligning inventory depth and staffing structure with demand density realities.
