# Case 14 — Regional Assortment Optimization Failure (Jazan vs Riyadh)

---

## Executive Summary

Uniform national assortment strategy reduced regional ROIC in Jazan by 2.4% despite strong performance in Riyadh. A climate-adjusted assortment recalibration improved Jazan profitability without impacting national supply continuity.

---

## Context

Quarter: Q2  
Regions Compared: Riyadh (Urban Core) vs Jazan (Southern Coastal)  
National Assortment Uniformity Policy: 82% SKU overlap  
ROIC Divergence: Riyadh 17.2% vs Jazan 14.8%  

Product categories showed performance inconsistency across regions.

---

## Baseline Financial Spine

National Revenue: 1.25B SAR  
Riyadh Revenue Share: 31%  
Jazan Revenue Share: 8%  
Logistics Cost to Jazan: +4.2% vs Riyadh  
Inventory Coverage (National Uniform): 30 days  
Jazan Slow-Moving SKU Ratio: 19%  
National ROIC: 16.5%

## Visual Insight

---

## Analytical Diagnosis

- Vitamin D & sunscreen high velocity in Riyadh  
- Hydration salts & antifungal treatments higher in Jazan  
- 17% of Riyadh high-performing SKUs underperforming in Jazan  
- Logistics premium reduced net contribution in low-velocity SKUs  

**Root Structural Cause:**  
Uniform assortment ignored climate, income distribution, and local demand pattern.

---

## Political & Behavioral Layer

Central buying resisted regional differentiation due to complexity concerns.  
Regional managers lacked autonomy to adjust assortment.  
Finance observed regional ROIC compression but no structural intervention.

---

## Executive Decision

Reduce uniform SKU overlap to 65% and introduce climate-adjusted regional assortment logic.

---

## Trade-off Matrix

| Strategic Gain | Financial Sacrifice | Risk Created | Net Economic Effect |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| +2.4% ROIC recovery in Jazan | 0.7M SAR assortment transition cost | Operational complexity increase | Structural regional profitability improvement |

**Capital Logic:**  
Allocating inventory based on regional velocity increases contribution per invested SAR.

## Counterfactual Scenario

If uniform policy maintained:

- Jazan ROIC erosion continues  
- Increased markdown pressure  
- Logistics cost absorption without velocity  
- National average masks regional inefficiency  

---

## Defensibility Test

### CFO Challenge  
Why complicate supply chain for 8% revenue region?

**Response:**  
Regional inefficiency compounds capital waste. Protecting regional ROIC strengthens national capital structure.

### COO Challenge  
Will assortment differentiation increase complexity?

**Response:**  
Overlap still maintained at 65%. Strategic differentiation applied only to climate-sensitive categories.

## Execution Reality

- 380 SKUs replaced in Jazan region  
- 11% reduction in slow-moving SKUs  
- Regional gross margin improved  
- Logistics-adjusted contribution increased  

---

## Financial Impact

Jazan ROIC: 14.8% → 17.2%  
Slow-Moving Ratio Reduced  
Markdown Reduction Achieved  
National ROIC Stabilized

## Decision Ownership

Decision Owner: Head of Commercial Intelligence  
Regional Lead: Southern Region Director  
Financial Oversight: CFO  
Review Cycle: Quarterly Regional Performance Audit  

---

## Lessons Learned

1. National averages hide regional weakness.  
2. Climate materially impacts category velocity.  
3. Logistics cost must be embedded in contribution analysis.  
4. Uniformity creates hidden inefficiency.  
5. Regional ROIC is a strategic metric.

## Capital Logic Summary

Regional assortment recalibration improved capital efficiency by aligning inventory allocation with local demand velocity and logistics-adjusted contribution.
