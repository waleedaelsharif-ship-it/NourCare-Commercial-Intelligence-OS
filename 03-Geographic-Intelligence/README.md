# Cluster 03 — Geographic Intelligence

---

## Strategic Intent

This cluster analyzes regional profitability divergence, logistics-adjusted contribution, climate-driven assortment variation, and capital allocation efficiency across geographic zones.

Primary Objective: Optimize ROIC per region rather than national revenue aggregation.

---

## Core Risk Themes

- Uniform assortment misalignment
- Climate-driven demand variation
- Logistics cost distortion
- Regional margin dilution
- Urban vs semi-urban profitability gap
- Distribution center distance impact
- Regional pricing elasticity differences

---

## Geographic Philosophy

National averages hide regional inefficiency.

Capital must be allocated based on:

- Regional contribution per invested SAR
- Logistics-adjusted gross margin
- Local demand velocity
- Climate and demographic impact
- Competitive intensity

---

## Governance Model

Decision Owner: Head of Commercial Intelligence  
Regional Accountability: Regional Directors  
Financial Oversight: CFO  
Review Cycle: Quarterly Regional ROIC Audit  

Escalation Trigger:  
If regional ROIC falls 1.5% below national benchmark for 2 consecutive quarters, intervention required.

## Cases in This Cluster

1. Regional Assortment Optimization Failure (Jazan vs Riyadh)
2. Logistics Cost Distortion Impact
3. Low-Density Branch Profitability Compression
4. Urban vs Semi-Urban SKU Mix Divergence
5. Regional Pricing Elasticity Gap
6. Distribution Center Distance Effect
7. Climate-Driven Category Misalignment

---

## Strategic Note

Geographic intelligence prevents national performance illusion and ensures capital is allocated where it generates superior regional return.
