# Case 17 — Urban vs Semi-Urban SKU Mix Divergence

---

## Executive Summary

Applying identical SKU mix strategy across urban and semi-urban branches reduced net contribution in semi-urban regions by 2.1%. A demand-segmented SKU rationalization model improved contribution efficiency and reduced 9M SAR misallocated capital.

Branch Segments: Urban Core (20 branches) vs Semi-Urban (18 branches)  
SKU Overlap: 78% identical assortment  
ROIC Divergence: Urban 17.5% vs Semi-Urban 15.4%  

National buying policy emphasized uniform brand exposure.

## Visual Insight

---

## Analytical Diagnosis

- 26% of premium SKUs underperformed in semi-urban locations  
- Higher price elasticity observed outside urban centers  
- Semi-urban consumers concentrated on essential OTC categories  
- Inventory depth for premium variants exceeded demand reality  

**Root Structural Cause:**  
Assortment strategy prioritized brand presence over localized demand economics.

---

## Political & Behavioral Layer

Brand suppliers pressured for national uniform presence.  
Central team concerned about brand dilution.  
Regional managers lacked pricing flexibility.

---

## Executive Decision

Segment SKU mix by branch tier, reducing premium depth in semi-urban branches and increasing essential SKU availability.

---

## Trade-off Matrix

| Strategic Gain | Financial Sacrifice | Risk Created | Net Economic Effect |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| 9M SAR capital reallocation | 0.8M SAR premium visibility reduction | Brand perception sensitivity | +2.1% regional ROIC improvement |

**Capital Logic:**  
Capital should follow price elasticity and velocity, not brand uniformity mandates.

---

## Counterfactual Scenario

If uniform SKU mix maintained:

- Continued slow-moving premium build-up  
- Markdown exposure  
- Semi-urban ROIC stagnation  
- Capital inefficiency accumulation  

---

## Defensibility Test

### CFO Challenge  
Why reduce premium assortment in growth regions?

**Response:**  
Premium velocity insufficient to justify inventory depth. Capital must follow demand reality.

### Marketing Challenge  
Will reduced premium visibility harm brand equity?

**Response:**  
Core premium SKUs retained. Only low-velocity variants removed.

---

## Execution Reality

- 280 premium SKUs removed from semi-urban branches  
- Essential SKU depth increased  
- Semi-urban inventory turnover improved to 6.2  
- Slow-moving ratio reduced by 18%  

---

## Financial Impact

Capital Reallocated: 9M SAR  
Semi-Urban ROIC: 15.4% → 17.3%  
Cash Cycle Improved  
National ROIC Stabilized

Category Alignment: Central Buying Team  
Regional Accountability: Semi-Urban Directors  
Review Cycle: Quarterly SKU Mix Audit

## Lessons Learned

1. Price elasticity varies by region.  
2. Premium depth must follow purchasing power.  
3. Uniform brand strategy creates capital inefficiency.  
4. Contribution > visibility.  
5. SKU mix segmentation strengthens network profitability.

## Capital Logic Summary

Demand-segmented SKU allocation restored capital efficiency by aligning assortment depth with purchasing behavior realities across branch tiers.
