# Case 18 — Regional Pricing Elasticity Gap

---

## Executive Summary

Uniform national pricing ignored regional elasticity differences, reducing net contribution in price-sensitive regions by 1.8%. A segmented pricing strategy improved regional gross margin and increased ROIC without affecting national brand positioning.

---

## Context

Quarter: Q2  
Regions Compared: Riyadh (High Purchasing Power) vs Northern Region (Price-Sensitive)  
Pricing Policy: National Fixed Price Strategy  
Observed Issue: Volume drop in price-sensitive regions  

Price uniformity designed to protect brand consistency.

---

## Baseline Financial Spine

National Gross Margin: 25.4%  
Riyadh Volume Growth: +6.2%  
Northern Region Volume Growth: -2.1%  
Elasticity Estimate (Northern): -1.4  
Elasticity Estimate (Riyadh): -0.6  
Regional ROIC Gap: -1.8%

## Visual Insight

---

## Analytical Diagnosis

- Same price point produced different volume responses  
- Competitors in northern region undercut pricing by 3–5%  
- Inventory turnover slower in price-sensitive region  
- Uniform margin target ignored elasticity variance  

**Root Structural Cause:**  
Pricing governance based on brand uniformity instead of elasticity modeling.

---

## Political & Behavioral Layer

Marketing insisted on unified brand pricing.  
Finance focused on maintaining national gross margin.  
Regional managers reported declining competitive position.

---

## Executive Decision

Implement controlled regional price flexibility within ±3% band for selected elastic SKUs.

---

## Trade-off Matrix

| Strategic Gain | Financial Sacrifice | Risk Created | Net Economic Effect |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| +1.8% regional ROIC recovery | 0.6M SAR margin dilution in premium regions | Brand pricing perception risk | Net contribution optimization |

**Capital Logic:**  
Volume elasticity adjustment improves contribution per invested inventory unit in price-sensitive regions.

---

## Counterfactual Scenario

If uniform pricing maintained:

- Continued volume erosion  
- Inventory turnover slowdown  
- Increased markdown risk  
- Regional competitive weakness  

---

## Defensibility Test

### CFO Challenge  
Why sacrifice margin in certain regions?

**Response:**  
Elasticity-driven pricing increases contribution through volume recovery and improved inventory velocity.

### Marketing Challenge  
Will regional pricing harm brand consistency?

**Response:**  
Flexibility limited to elasticity-sensitive SKUs within controlled band. Core price architecture maintained.

## Execution Reality

- 140 SKUs adjusted regionally  
- Northern volume improved +5.4%  
- Inventory turnover increased to 6.5  
- Regional gross margin stabilized  

---

## Financial Impact

Regional ROIC: +1.8%  
Volume Recovery Achieved  
Inventory Efficiency Improved  
National Margin Stable  

---

## Decision Ownership

Decision Owner: Head of Commercial Intelligence  
Pricing Governance: Central Pricing Committee  
Financial Oversight: CFO  
Review Cycle: Quarterly Elasticity Review  

---

## Lessons Learned

1. Elasticity differs materially by region.  
2. Uniform pricing can erode contribution.  
3. Volume recovery improves capital velocity.  
4. Brand consistency must coexist with economic reality.  
5. Pricing intelligence is regional, not national.

---

## Capital Logic Summary

Elasticity-adjusted pricing aligned revenue strategy with regional demand behavior, restoring contribution efficiency and protecting ROIC.
