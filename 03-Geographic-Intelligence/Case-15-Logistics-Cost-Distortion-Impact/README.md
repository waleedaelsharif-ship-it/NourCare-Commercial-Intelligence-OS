# Case 15 — Logistics Cost Distortion Impact

---

## Executive Summary

A gross margin–focused pricing model masked regional logistics distortion, causing 1.9% ROIC compression in remote branches. Embedding logistics-adjusted contribution analysis restored capital allocation accuracy and improved regional profitability.

---

## Context

Quarter: Q3  
Regions Impacted: Southern & Northern Remote Branches  
Distribution Model: Centralized DC (Riyadh)  
Average Additional Logistics Cost (Remote): +3.8%  

National pricing assumed uniform gross margin without embedding regional delivery cost variation.

---

## Baseline Financial Spine

National Gross Margin: 25.1%  
Remote Region Gross Margin: 24.8%  
Logistics Premium (Remote): +3.8%  
Remote Inventory Coverage: 32 days  
Remote ROIC: 14.9%  
National ROIC: 16.8%

## Visual Insight

---

## Analytical Diagnosis

- 22% of SKUs profitable nationally but negative net contribution in remote regions  
- Low-velocity SKUs disproportionately affected by transport cost  
- Pricing uniformity ignored distribution distance  
- Gross margin metric overstated real regional profitability  

**Root Structural Cause:**  
Capital allocation decisions based on gross margin instead of logistics-adjusted contribution.

---

## Political & Behavioral Layer

Finance monitored national gross margin only.  
Regional directors flagged profitability compression.  
Central pricing team resisted regional price differentiation.

---

## Executive Decision

Introduce logistics-adjusted contribution reporting and remove negative net-contribution SKUs from remote regions.

---

## Trade-off Matrix

| Strategic Gain | Financial Sacrifice | Risk Created | Net Economic Effect |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| +1.9% regional ROIC recovery | 0.5M SAR assortment adjustment cost | Minor assortment reduction | Structural profitability correction |

**Capital Logic:**  
Gross margin without logistics adjustment creates capital misallocation and hidden value destruction.

---

## Counterfactual Scenario

If gross margin model maintained:

- Continued remote ROIC erosion  
- Capital tied in low-contribution SKUs  
- Margin illusion at national level  
- Increased markdown pressure  

---

## Defensibility Test

### CFO Challenge  
Why complicate reporting with logistics adjustments?

**Response:**  
Gross margin overstates profitability. Capital allocation must reflect true net contribution.

### COO Challenge  
Will SKU removal hurt competitiveness?

**Response:**  
Only negative net-contribution SKUs removed. High-velocity items preserved.

## Execution Reality

- 420 SKUs removed from remote assortment  
- Logistics-adjusted reporting implemented  
- Remote gross margin improved post-adjustment  
- Inventory coverage optimized  

---

## Financial Impact

Remote ROIC: 14.9% → 16.8%  
Net Contribution Accuracy Restored  
Inventory Compression Achieved  
National ROIC Stability Maintained

## Decision Ownership

Decision Owner: Head of Commercial Intelligence  
Regional Accountability: Remote Region Directors  
Financial Oversight: CFO  
Review Cycle: Quarterly Logistics-Adjusted Profitability Audit  

---

## Lessons Learned

1. Gross margin is not net profitability.  
2. Distance distorts contribution.  
3. Capital allocation must reflect true cost.  
4. Reporting design influences strategic blindness.  
5. Regional ROIC requires logistics intelligence.

---

## Capital Logic Summary

Embedding logistics-adjusted contribution into regional reporting eliminated profitability illusion and improved capital deployment accuracy.
