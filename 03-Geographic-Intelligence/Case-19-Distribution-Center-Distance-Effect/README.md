# Case 19 — Distribution Center Distance Effect

---

## Executive Summary

Branches located more than 900 km from the central distribution center maintained 35% higher safety stock buffers, locking 13.5M SAR excess capital. A distance-adjusted replenishment model reduced capital lock-up while preserving service levels.

---

## Context

Quarter: Q3  
Distribution Model: Single Central DC (Riyadh)  
Remote Branches: Southern & Northern Regions  
Distance Range: 850–1,200 km  
Capital at Risk: 13.5M SAR excess safety stock  

Replenishment lead time varied significantly by region.

---

## Baseline Financial Spine

Average Lead Time (Urban): 2.8 days  
Average Lead Time (Remote): 5.4 days  
Remote Safety Stock Coverage: 38 days  
Urban Safety Stock Coverage: 26 days  
Inventory Turnover (Remote): 5.6  
National Turnover: 6.9  
Remote ROIC: 15.2%  
National ROIC: 17.1%

## Visual Insight

---

## Analytical Diagnosis

- Remote branches increased buffer beyond statistical requirement  
- Forecast variance overestimated in distance zones  
- Replenishment frequency static across network  
- Inventory planning not distance-sensitive  

**Root Structural Cause:**  
Safety stock formula ignored differentiated lead-time variability and demand concentration.

---

## Political & Behavioral Layer

Remote managers demanded high buffer for “security.”  
Central supply chain resisted decentralized replenishment.  
Finance observed higher capital allocation in remote zones.

---

## Executive Decision

Implement distance-adjusted dynamic safety stock formula and increase replenishment frequency for high-velocity SKUs.

---

## Trade-off Matrix

| Strategic Gain | Financial Sacrifice | Risk Created | Net Economic Effect |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| 13.5M SAR capital release | 0.7M SAR increased transport frequency cost | 2% lead-time risk exposure | Structural capital efficiency improvement |

**Capital Logic:**  
Frequent replenishment reduces required safety buffer and frees invested capital.

---

## Counterfactual Scenario

If high buffer maintained:

- Continued capital inefficiency  
- Higher markdown exposure  
- Slower remote inventory turnover  
- ROIC gap persists  

---

## Defensibility Test

### CFO Challenge  
Why increase transport frequency cost?

**Response:**  
Transport cost (0.7M SAR) significantly lower than capital lock-up cost (13.5M SAR × 9% cost of capital).

### COO Challenge  
Will lower buffer risk stockouts?

**Response:**  
Model based on statistical demand variability, not fear-based estimation.

---

## Execution Reality

- Safety stock reduced 22% in remote branches  
- Replenishment cycle shortened  
- Inventory turnover improved to 6.4  
- Service level maintained above 95%  

---

## Financial Impact

Capital Released: 13.5M SAR  
ROIC (Remote): 15.2% → 17.0%  
Cash Conversion Improvement  
Network Efficiency Enhanced

## Decision Ownership

Decision Owner: Head of Commercial Intelligence  
Supply Chain Lead: Distribution Director  
Financial Oversight: CFO  
Review Cycle: Quarterly Lead-Time Review  

---

## Lessons Learned

1. Distance inflates perceived risk.  
2. Buffer logic must reflect lead-time reality.  
3. Transport frequency can replace capital buffer.  
4. Statistical modeling reduces fear-driven overstock.  
5. Geographic intelligence requires supply chain adaptation.

---

## Capital Logic Summary

Distance-adjusted replenishment optimized safety stock allocation, improved regional capital efficiency, and strengthened network-wide ROIC stability.
