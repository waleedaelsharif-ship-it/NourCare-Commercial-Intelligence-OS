# Case 28 — AI Forecast Pilot Integration

---

## Executive Summary

A machine-learning forecast pilot reduced demand forecast bias from +12% to +3.8%, lowered safety stock requirements by 14%, and released 17M SAR in excess working capital while maintaining service level above 96%.

---

## Context

Pre-Pilot Forecast Model:
- Historical moving average
- Seasonal uplift multiplier
- Manual adjustment layer

Observed Problem:
Persistent overestimation bias across 4 major categories.

---

## Baseline Financial Spine

Forecast Bias (Before): +12%  
Safety Stock Coverage: 34 days  
Inventory Value: 192M SAR  
Inventory Turnover: 7.8  
Service Level: 97%  
ROIC: 20.7%  

---

## Pilot Scope

- 1,800 SKUs  
- 4 High-Volatility Categories  
- 12-Month Historical Dataset  
- Weekly Rolling Forecast  

---

## Analytical Diagnosis

- Manual forecast adjustments amplified seasonal fear  
- Static uplift multipliers ignored real-time demand signals  
- Forecast error variance inflated safety stock  

**Root Structural Cause:**  
Human bias embedded in forecasting process.

---

## Executive Decision

Deploy AI-based rolling demand forecast for pilot categories and recalibrate safety stock dynamically.

---

## Trade-off Matrix

| Strategic Gain | Financial Sacrifice | Risk Created | Net Economic Effect |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| 17M SAR capital release | 1.5M SAR model development cost | Forecast model dependency risk | Structural capital efficiency gain |

---

## Capital Logic

Reduced forecast bias lowers required safety stock buffer and improves capital velocity.

---

## Counterfactual Scenario

If traditional forecasting maintained:

- Safety stock inflation persists  
- Capital lock-up increases  
- ROIC plateau  
- Slow risk detection  

---

## Defensibility Test

### CFO Challenge  
Is AI deployment justified by capital impact?

**Response:**  
17M SAR working capital release exceeds pilot cost multiple times.

### COO Challenge  
Will model error create stockout risk?

**Response:**  
Model deployed with dynamic confidence bands and manual override guardrails.

---

## Execution Reality

- Forecast bias reduced to +3.8%  
- Safety stock coverage reduced to 29 days  
- Service level maintained at 96%  
- Working capital improved  

---

## Financial Impact

Working Capital Released: 17M SAR  
ROIC: 20.7% → 22.1%  
Inventory Turnover Improved  
Forecast Accuracy Increased  

---

## Decision Ownership

Decision Owner: Head of Commercial Intelligence  
Technical Lead: Data Analytics Team  
Financial Oversight: CFO  
Review Cycle: Monthly Forecast Accuracy Audit  

---

## Lessons Learned

1. Human bias inflates capital buffers.  
2. Forecast accuracy directly impacts working capital.  
3. AI improves volatility management.  
4. Guardrails required for automation trust.  
5. Predictive intelligence strengthens capital discipline.

---

## Capital Logic Summary

AI-driven forecasting reduced structural overestimation, improved capital velocity, and strengthened enterprise-wide ROIC stability.
