# Case 27 — Unified Executive Dashboard Architecture

---

## Executive Summary

Fragmented reporting across clusters limited executive visibility into capital efficiency. A unified ROIC-centered executive dashboard integrated inventory, margin, seasonal volatility, and regional contribution into a single decision interface.

---

## Context

Pre-Implementation State:
- Separate dashboards for Sales
- Separate inventory reporting
- Separate margin reports
- No consolidated capital efficiency view

Executive decisions lacked unified economic visibility.

---

## Baseline Problem

- Sales dashboard emphasized revenue growth  
- Margin dashboard ignored capital intensity  
- Inventory dashboard disconnected from ROIC  
- Seasonal stress reports isolated  

Board discussions lacked integrated capital logic.

---

## Executive Decision

Design a Unified Executive Capital Dashboard centered around ROIC, Contribution Density, and Cash Conversion Cycle.

---

## Dashboard Architecture

### Layer 1 — Capital Core
- ROIC (Network & Regional)
- Cash Conversion Cycle
- Working Capital Trend

### Layer 2 — Contribution Intelligence
- Blended Gross Margin
- Net Contribution Index
- Private Label Mix

### Layer 3 — Inventory Governance
- Inventory Turnover
- Safety Stock Coverage
- Dead Stock Ratio

### Layer 4 — Geographic Intelligence
- Regional ROIC Heatmap
- Logistics-Adjusted Contribution

### Layer 5 — Seasonal Stress Indicators
- Demand Volatility Index
- Promotion Intensity Ratio

## Trade-off Matrix

| Strategic Gain | Financial Sacrifice | Risk Created | Net Economic Effect |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| Decision integration clarity | 1.2M SAR BI development cost | Reporting transition complexity | Structural executive alignment |

---

## Capital Logic

Capital efficiency must be visible in a single interface.

Fragmented reporting produces fragmented decisions.

---

## Execution Reality

- Power BI unified dashboard deployed  
- Board review sessions shortened  
- Cross-functional alignment improved  
- ROIC visibility increased  

---

## Financial Impact

Improved Capital Allocation Speed  
Faster Risk Detection  
ROIC Stabilization Above 20%  

---

## Decision Ownership

Dashboard Owner: Head of Commercial Intelligence  
Executive Users: CEO, CFO, COO  
Review Cycle: Monthly Executive Session  

---

## Lessons Learned

1. Fragmented dashboards fragment accountability.  
2. ROIC must anchor executive visibility.  
3. Capital logic requires integrated data.  
4. Decision clarity improves governance.  
5. Executive intelligence must be unified.

---

## Capital Logic Summary

A unified executive dashboard consolidated operational intelligence into board-level capital governance architecture.
