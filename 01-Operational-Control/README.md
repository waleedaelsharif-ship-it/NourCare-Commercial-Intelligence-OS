# Cluster 01 — Operational Control

## Strategic Intent
This cluster focuses on capital protection, working capital discipline, and inventory governance.

Primary Objective: Protect Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) through disciplined operational control.

---

## Core Risk Themes
- Dead stock accumulation
- Expiry loss leakage
- Working capital freeze
- Inventory vs cash conflict
- KPI manipulation (channel stuffing)
- Capital market exposure (SAIBOR shock)

---

## Decision Philosophy
Every operational decision must answer:

Did this increase capital efficiency without compromising supply continuity?

---

## Executive KPI Focus
- Inventory Turnover
- Dead Stock %
- Working Capital Delta
- Cash Conversion Cycle
- ROIC
- Financing Cost Exposure

---

## Capital Performance Target (Cluster 01)
Target Outcomes for Q1:
- Dead Stock Reduction: -20%
- Inventory Turnover: 5.8 → 6.4
- Working Capital Release: 20M+ SAR
- ROIC Improvement: +1.2%
- Cash Conversion Cycle Reduction: -6 days

This cluster measures operational discipline through capital efficiency, not sales growth.

---

## Governance Model
Decision Owner: Head of Commercial Intelligence  
Financial Oversight: CFO  
Execution Accountability: Regional Operations Managers  
Review Cycle: Monthly capital discipline review  

Escalation Rule: If inventory growth exceeds sales growth by >5% for 2 consecutive months, executive intervention is triggered.
