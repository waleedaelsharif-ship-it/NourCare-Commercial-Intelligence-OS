# Case 02 — Expiry Loss Financial Drain

---

## Executive Summary

A targeted expiry containment initiative reduced projected write-offs by 4.1M SAR, stabilized gross margin leakage, and preserved ROIC above 15% without disrupting supply continuity.

---

## Context

Quarter: Q2  
Season: Post-Ramadan Normalization  
Scope: National (48 branches)  
Capital at Risk: 6.4M SAR projected expiry losses (next 90 days)

Following aggressive pre-Ramadan stocking, NourCare identified elevated near-expiry exposure across OTC and seasonal SKUs.

---

## Baseline Financial Spine

Revenue: 1.18B SAR (annualized)  
Gross Margin: 24.6%  
Inventory Value: 142M SAR (post-season peak)  
Near-Expiry Exposure (≤90 days): 6.4M SAR  
Historical Write-off Average: 3.8M SAR annually  
Inventory Turnover: 6.4  
ROIC: 15.1%  
Cost of Capital: 9%

## Visual Insight

---

## Analytical Diagnosis

- 22% of near-expiry SKUs concentrated in five categories  
- 48% of exposure driven by promotional bundle overstock  
- Weak aging visibility at branch level  
- Limited inter-branch redistribution controls  

**Root Structural Cause:**  
Promotion-driven overstocking combined with inadequate aging-based redistribution governance.

---

## Political & Behavioral Layer

- Branch managers optimized for sell-in volume rather than sell-through velocity  
- Suppliers incentivized bulk seasonal purchasing  
- Regional dashboards emphasized revenue uplift over aging exposure  

---

## Executive Decision

Implement a 60-day expiry containment protocol combining tactical markdowns, inter-branch redistribution, and supplier return negotiations.

---

## Trade-off Matrix

| Strategic Gain | Financial Sacrifice | Risk Created | Net Economic Effect |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| 4.1M SAR write-off reduction | 1.2M SAR markdown cost | Short-term margin compression | +2.9M SAR capital recovery |

**Capital Logic:**  
Preventing write-offs protects capital permanently. Markdown cost is temporary margin compression; write-offs are irreversible capital destruction.

---

## Counterfactual Scenario

Without intervention:

- Projected expiry loss: 6.4M SAR  
- Margin erosion: -0.8%  
- ROIC decline: -0.6%  
- Increased supplier strain following loss recognition  

---

## Defensibility Test

### CFO Challenge  
Why not accept expiry losses instead of compressing margins?

**Response:**  
Write-offs permanently destroy capital and reduce ROIC. Controlled markdown and redistribution preserve liquidity and partially recover margin while protecting enterprise capital efficiency.

### CEO Challenge  
Will discounting damage brand perception?

**Response:**  
Markdowns were selective, time-bound, and category-specific. No broad price signaling applied to core strategic SKUs.

---

## Execution Reality

- 2.8M SAR redistributed to high-velocity branches  
- 1.9M SAR cleared via tactical markdown  
- 1.4M SAR negotiated as supplier return credit  
- Final write-off limited to 2.3M SAR  

---

## Financial Impact

Write-off Reduction: 6.4M → 2.3M SAR  
Gross Margin Stabilization: -0.3% vs projected -0.8%  
ROIC Maintained: >15%  
Cash Preservation: +4.1M SAR

## Decision Ownership

Decision Owner: Head of Commercial Intelligence  
Financial Oversight: CFO  
Execution Lead: Regional Operations Directors  
Review Cycle: 45-day aging audit  

---

## Lessons Learned

1. Expiry exposure is a capital governance issue, not merely a sales issue.  
2. Aging must be monitored weekly during seasonal transitions.  
3. Promotions require defined exit strategies.  
4. Redistribution frequently outperforms blanket discounting.  
5. Write-off prevention directly protects ROIC.

---

## Capital Logic Summary

Expiry containment prevented irreversible capital destruction, stabilized gross margin erosion, and reinforced aging discipline as a core element of commercial governance.
