# Case 02 — Expiry Loss Financial Drain

---

## Executive Summary

A targeted expiry containment initiative reduced projected write-offs by 4.1M SAR, stabilized gross margin leakage, and improved capital recovery efficiency without disrupting supply continuity.

---

## Context

Quarter: Q2  
Season: Post-Ramadan normalization  
Scope: National (48 branches)  
Capital at Risk: 6.4M SAR projected expiry losses (next 90 days)

Following aggressive pre-Ramadan stocking, NourCare identified elevated near-expiry exposure across multiple OTC and seasonal SKUs.

---

## Baseline Financial Spine

Revenue: 1.18B SAR (annualized)  
Gross Margin: 24.6%  
Inventory Value: 142M SAR (post-season peak)  
Near-Expiry Exposure (≤90 days): 6.4M SAR  
Write-off Historical Average: 3.8M SAR annually  
Inventory Turnover: 6.4  
ROIC: 15.1%  
Cost of Capital: 9%

## Visual Insight

![Expiry Exposure Aging Analysis](Expiry_Aging_Analysis.png)

---

## Analytical Diagnosis

- 22% of near-expiry SKUs concentrated in 5 categories
- 48% of exposure driven by overstocked promotional bundles
- Weak aging visibility at branch level
- Limited inter-branch stock reallocation

**Root Structural Cause:**  
Promotion-driven overstocking combined with inadequate aging-based redistribution controls.

---

## Political & Behavioral Layer

Branch managers prioritized sell-in over sell-through.
Suppliers incentivized bulk promotional uptake.
Regional reporting focused on revenue uplift rather than aging discipline.

---

## Executive Decision

Implement a 60-day expiry containment protocol combining targeted markdowns, inter-branch redistribution, and supplier return negotiations.

---

## Trade-off Matrix

| Strategic Gain | Financial Sacrifice | Risk Created | Net Economic Effect |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| 4.1M SAR write-off reduction | 1.2M SAR markdown cost | Short-term margin compression | +2.9M SAR capital recovery |

**Capital Logic:**  
Prevented write-offs preserve capital permanently, whereas markdown cost is temporary margin impact.

---

## Counterfactual Scenario

Without intervention:

- Projected expiry loss: 6.4M SAR  
- Margin erosion: -0.8%  
- ROIC decline: -0.6%  
- Increased supplier tension post-write-off cycle  

---

## Defensibility Test

### CFO Challenge  
Why not accept expiry losses instead of discounting margins?

**Response:**  
Write-offs destroy capital permanently. Controlled markdown preserves liquidity and recovers partial margin while protecting ROIC.

### CEO Challenge  
Will discounting damage brand perception?

**Response:**  
Markdowns were targeted, time-bound, and category-controlled. No broad price signaling applied.

---

## Execution Reality

- 2.8M SAR redistributed to high-velocity branches
- 1.9M SAR cleared via tactical markdown
- 1.4M SAR negotiated as supplier return credit
- Final write-off limited to 2.3M SAR

---

## Financial Impact

Write-off Reduction: 6.4M → 2.3M SAR  
Gross Margin Stabilization: -0.3% vs projected -0.8%  
ROIC Protection: Maintained at 15%+  
Cash Preservation: +4.1M SAR

## Decision Ownership

Decision Owner: Head of Commercial Intelligence  
Financial Oversight: CFO  
Execution Lead: Regional Operations Directors  
Review Cycle: 45-day aging audit  

---

## Lessons Learned

1. Expiry risk is a capital discipline failure, not a sales issue.  
2. Aging visibility must be monitored weekly, not quarterly.  
3. Promotion without exit strategy creates structural loss.  
4. Redistribution often outperforms markdown.  
5. Write-off prevention protects ROIC directly.

---

## Capital Logic Summary

Expiry containment prevented permanent capital destruction, stabilized gross margin erosion, and reinforced aging governance discipline across the network.
