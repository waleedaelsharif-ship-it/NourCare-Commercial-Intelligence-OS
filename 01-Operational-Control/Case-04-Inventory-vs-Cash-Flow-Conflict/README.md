# Case 04 — Inventory vs Cash Flow Conflict

---

## Executive Summary

A capital allocation conflict emerged between inventory expansion plans and cash flow preservation targets. A controlled inventory cap strategy prevented 25M SAR additional capital lock-up and stabilized cash conversion cycle during liquidity tightening.

---

## Context

Quarter: Q4  
Season: Non-Seasonal Stable Period  
Scope: National (48 branches)  
Capital at Risk: 25M SAR planned inventory expansion  

Following supplier incentives and growth pressure, operations proposed inventory build-up to support expansion. Finance warned of cash strain and capital inefficiency.

---

## Baseline Financial Spine

Revenue: 1.22B SAR (annualized projection)  
Inventory Value: 158M SAR  
Inventory Turnover: 6.3  
Cash Conversion Cycle: 68 days  
ROIC: 15.8%  
Planned Inventory Increase: +25M SAR  
Cost of Capital: 9%  

---

## Analytical Diagnosis

- Expansion inventory built on optimistic growth forecast (+9%)  
- Sales growth trending at +4.5% only  
- Inventory growth projected to exceed sales growth by >10%  
- No incremental service level benefit expected  

**Root Structural Cause:**  
Growth-driven stocking disconnected from capital discipline thresholds.

---

## Political & Behavioral Layer

Operations incentivized on availability and expansion footprint.  
Finance incentivized on cash stability and ROIC.  
No shared capital governance metric aligned both functions.

---

## Executive Decision

Reject full inventory expansion and implement a capital-neutral stocking policy tied to actual sales velocity.

---

## Trade-off Matrix

| Strategic Gain | Financial Sacrifice | Risk Created | Net Economic Effect |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| 25M SAR capital preserved | Loss of 1.4M SAR supplier rebate | 2% service expansion delay | +22.8M SAR capital protection |

**Capital Logic:**  
25M SAR × 9% cost of capital = 2.25M SAR annual financing exposure avoided, exceeding rebate benefit.

---

## Counterfactual Scenario

If expansion proceeded:

- Cash Conversion Cycle increase: +9 days  
- ROIC decline: -1.1%  
- Increased short-term borrowing exposure  
- Vulnerability to SAIBOR increase  

---

## Defensibility Test

### CFO Challenge  
Does limiting expansion restrict growth potential?

**Response:**  
Inventory expansion without velocity confirmation creates negative ROIC. Growth must follow demand proof, not anticipation.

### COO Challenge  
Will service levels suffer?

**Response:**  
Inventory maintained at velocity-based thresholds. High-turn categories fully protected.

---

## Execution Reality

- Expansion cap applied to 4 key categories  
- Inventory growth limited to +4%  
- Cash cycle stabilized  
- No measurable service level decline  

---

## Financial Impact

Capital Preserved: 25M SAR  
Cash Conversion Cycle Maintained at 68 days  
ROIC Maintained Above 15.5%  
Financing Risk Reduced  

---

## Decision Ownership

Decision Owner: Head of Commercial Intelligence  
Financial Oversight: CFO  
Operational Alignment: COO  
Review Cycle: Quarterly capital review  

---

## Lessons Learned

1. Inventory expansion must be velocity-validated.  
2. Supplier rebates rarely justify capital lock-up.  
3. Cash stability is a strategic asset.  
4. Growth without capital discipline erodes ROIC.  
5. Finance and operations require shared capital governance KPIs.

---

## Capital Logic Summary

Capital preservation prevented structural ROIC erosion and aligned operational growth with liquidity discipline.
