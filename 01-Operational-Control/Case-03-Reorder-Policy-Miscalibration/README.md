# Case 03 — Reorder Policy Miscalibration

---

## Executive Summary

A safety stock misalignment and forecast overestimation inflated inventory buffers by 17%, locking 18.6M SAR in excess capital and reducing capital efficiency without improving service levels.

---

## Context

Quarter: Q3  
Season: Stable Demand Period  
Scope: National (48 branches)  
Capital at Risk: 18.6M SAR excess safety stock  

NourCare identified persistent overstock in fast-moving categories despite stable demand and no seasonal volatility.

---

## Baseline Financial Spine

Revenue: 1.18B SAR (annualized)  
Inventory Value: 150M SAR  
Inventory Turnover: 6.1  
Service Level: 96%  
Safety Stock Coverage: 42 days  
Target Safety Coverage: 28 days  
ROIC: 15.0%  
Cost of Capital: 9%

## Visual Insight

---

## Analytical Diagnosis

- Forecast bias: +14% overestimation across 3 core categories  
- Safety stock formula based on peak volatility rather than rolling demand  
- Reorder points not recalibrated post-Ramadan  
- Service level remained unchanged despite higher stock buffers  

**Root Structural Cause:**  
Static safety stock assumptions applied in dynamic demand conditions.

---

## Political & Behavioral Layer

Supply chain resisted recalibration due to fear of stockouts.  
Regional managers equated high service level with high stock coverage.  
No KPI tied to capital efficiency at reorder level.

---

## Executive Decision

Recalibrate reorder points and reduce safety stock coverage from 42 to 30 days using rolling demand variability models.

---

## Trade-off Matrix

| Strategic Gain | Financial Sacrifice | Risk Created | Net Economic Effect |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| 18.6M SAR capital release | 0.5% temporary service level risk | Minor stockout volatility | +16.9M SAR net capital efficiency |

**Capital Logic:**  
Reducing safety stock improves capital turnover without materially affecting service continuity.

---

## Counterfactual Scenario

Without recalibration:

- Inventory creep projected to reach 165M SAR  
- ROIC erosion: -0.9%  
- Cash conversion cycle extension: +8 days  
- Hidden cost of capital accumulation  

---

## Defensibility Test

### CFO Challenge  
Why risk service level to free capital?

**Response:**  
Service level above 95% shows diminishing return. Excess buffer above optimal point generates negative capital efficiency.

### COO Challenge  
What if forecast error reverses?

**Response:**  
Rolling variance model updates reorder points monthly, preventing structural understock risk.

## Execution Reality

- Reorder formulas recalculated across 2,300 SKUs  
- 12.4M SAR reduction achieved within 8 weeks  
- Service level stabilized at 95.4%  
- Working capital cycle improved by 5 days  

---

## Financial Impact

Inventory Reduction: -12.4M SAR  
Working Capital Released: 12.4M SAR  
ROIC Improvement: 15.0% → 15.8%  
Cash Cycle Improvement: -5 days

## Decision Ownership

Decision Owner: Head of Commercial Intelligence  
Operational Owner: Supply Chain Director  
Financial Oversight: CFO  
Review Cycle: Monthly forecast recalibration  

---

## Lessons Learned

1. High service level does not justify unlimited buffer.  
2. Safety stock must follow volatility, not fear.  
3. Forecast bias silently destroys capital.  
4. Reorder logic requires quarterly governance review.  
5. Capital efficiency begins at formula level.

## Capital Logic Summary

Recalibrating reorder policy restored capital discipline at the algorithmic level, proving that operational formulas directly influence enterprise ROIC.
