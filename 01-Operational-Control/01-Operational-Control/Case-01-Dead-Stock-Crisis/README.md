# Case 01 — Dead Stock Containment Crisis

## Context

Quarter: Q1  
Season: Pre-Ramadan buildup  
Region: National (48 branches)  
Capital at Risk: 11.2M SAR dead stock (>120 days)

NourCare experienced increasing slow-moving inventory accumulation, freezing capital and weakening cash flexibility before Ramadan.

---

## Baseline Financial Snapshot

Revenue: 1.18B SAR (annualized)  
Gross Margin: 24.6%  
Inventory Value: 138M SAR  
Dead Stock: 11.2M SAR  
Working Capital Cycle: 74 days  
ROIC: 13.8%

---

## Analytical Diagnosis

- 14% of SKUs generated <1% revenue contribution
- Inventory growth +12% YoY
- Sales growth +5% YoY
- Inventory Turnover declining from 6.2 → 5.8
- Divergence ratio exceeded internal threshold

Root Cause:
Over-purchasing ahead of seasonal uncertainty.

---

## The Decision

Reduce slow-moving inventory by 18% before Ramadan to release capital and stabilize working capital.

---

## Trade-off Matrix

| Gain | Sacrifice | Risk Created | Net Economic Effect |
|------|----------|--------------|--------------------|
| 22M SAR liquidity released | 2.3M SAR lost volume discount | 4% temporary stockout risk | +1.6M SAR net economic benefit |

---

## Counterfactual

Without intervention:
- Dead stock projected to reach 15M SAR
- Financing exposure increase: 1.2M SAR annually
- Working capital cycle extended to 82 days

---

## Defensibility Test

### CFO Challenge
Why reduce inventory instead of extending supplier payment terms?

Answer:
Supplier concentration risk at 62%. Extending terms weakens long-term leverage and does not reduce capital employed. Inventory reduction improves ROIC structurally.

### CEO Challenge
Will this hurt Ramadan availability?

Answer:
Safety stock preserved for top 20% revenue drivers. Reduction targeted low-velocity SKUs only.

---

## Execution Reality

- 6M SAR liquidated via bundle pricing
- 3M SAR returned to suppliers
- 13% reduction achieved within 6 weeks
- Minor stockouts in non-core SKUs (acceptable threshold)

---

## Financial Impact

EBITDA Improvement: +0.9%  
Working Capital Released: 22M SAR  
ROIC improved from 13.8% → 15.1%

---

## Lessons Learned

1. Seasonal fear drives irrational inventory expansion.
2. Volume discount is irrelevant if capital is frozen.
3. Inventory growth must not exceed sales growth.
4. Working capital discipline is a strategic lever.
5. ROIC is the ultimate operational truth metric.
