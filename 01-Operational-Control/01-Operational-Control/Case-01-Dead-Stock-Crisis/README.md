# Case 01 — Dead Stock Containment Crisis

---

## Context

Quarter: Q1  
Season: Pre-Ramadan Buildup  
Scope: National (48 branches)  
Capital at Risk: 11.2M SAR dead stock (>120 days)

Ahead of Ramadan, NourCare experienced accelerated inventory accumulation driven by demand uncertainty, resulting in capital freeze and weakening cash flexibility before peak season.

---

## Baseline Financial Spine

Revenue: 1.18B SAR (annualized)  
Gross Margin: 24.6%  
Inventory Value: 138M SAR  
Dead Stock Exposure: 11.2M SAR  
Working Capital Cycle: 74 days  
Inventory Turnover: 5.8  
ROIC: 13.8%  
Cost of Capital (assumed): 9%

---

## Analytical Diagnosis

- 14% of SKUs generated <1% revenue contribution  
- Inventory growth +12% YoY vs Sales growth +5% YoY  
- Inventory Turnover declined 6.2 → 5.8  
- Divergence Ratio breached internal control threshold (>5%)

**Root Structural Cause:**  
Pre-season over-purchasing driven by availability anxiety rather than velocity modeling.

---

## Executive Decision

Reduce slow-moving inventory by 18% before Ramadan to release capital, restore turnover discipline, and improve ROIC.

---

## Trade-off Matrix

| Strategic Gain | Financial Sacrifice | Risk Created | Net Economic Effect |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| 22M SAR liquidity released | 2.3M SAR lost volume discount | 4% temporary stockout risk | +1.6M SAR net capital benefit |

**Capital Logic:**  
22M SAR liquidity × 9% cost of capital = 1.98M SAR financing avoidance, exceeding discount loss exposure.

---

## Counterfactual Scenario

Without intervention:

- Dead stock projected to reach 15M SAR  
- Financing exposure increase: +1.2M SAR annually  
- Working Capital Cycle extension: 74 → 82 days  
- Elevated Ramadan cash strain risk  

---

## Defensibility Test

### CFO Challenge  
Why reduce inventory instead of extending supplier payment terms?

**Response:**  
Supplier concentration risk at 62%. Extending payment terms delays pressure but does not reduce capital employed. Structural inventory reduction improves ROIC permanently.

### CEO Challenge  
Will Ramadan availability suffer?

**Response:**  
Reduction targeted only low-velocity SKUs. Top 20% revenue drivers fully protected. Supply continuity maintained.

---

## Execution Reality

- 6M SAR liquidated via controlled bundle pricing  
- 3M SAR returned to suppliers  
- 13% reduction achieved within 6 weeks  
- Minor stockouts in non-core SKUs within tolerance threshold  

Execution demonstrated that liquidity recovery requires disciplined tactical sacrifice.

---

## Financial Impact

Working Capital Released: 22M SAR  
Inventory Turnover: 5.8 → 6.4  
Working Capital Cycle Reduction: -6 days  
ROIC Improvement: 13.8% → 15.1%  
EBITDA Impact: +0.9%

## Decision Ownership

Decision Owner: Head of Commercial Intelligence  
Financial Oversight: CFO  
Execution Lead: Regional Operations Directors  
Review Cycle: 30-day capital audit  

---

## Lessons Learned

1. Inventory anxiety destroys capital efficiency.  
2. Volume discounts are irrelevant when capital is immobilized.  
3. Inventory growth must not exceed sales growth structurally.  
4. Capital discipline must precede seasonal expansion.  
5. ROIC is the ultimate operational truth metric.  

---

## Capital Logic Summary

The intervention released critical liquidity ahead of peak season, reduced financing exposure, and restored capital efficiency discipline across the organization.

NourCare shifted from reactive stocking behavior to structured capital governance.
