# Case 05 — KPI Manipulation Detection

---

## Executive Summary

Artificial sales inflation through end-of-month channel stuffing temporarily boosted reported revenue by 3.6%, but increased inventory imbalance and locked 14.2M SAR in non-productive capital. Intervention restored reporting integrity and capital discipline.

---

## Context

Quarter: Q4  
Season: Year-End Performance Pressure  
Scope: National (48 branches)  
Capital at Risk: 14.2M SAR excess internal transfers  

Regional managers pushed inventory to branches in final reporting weeks to inflate sell-in metrics and achieve bonus thresholds.

---

## Baseline Financial Spine

Reported Revenue Growth: +8.1%  
True Sell-Through Growth: +4.3%  
Inventory Growth: +11.5%  
Inventory Turnover: 6.4 → 5.9  
Cash Conversion Cycle: 68 → 75 days  
ROIC: 15.5%  

---

## Analytical Diagnosis

- Divergence between sell-in vs sell-through  
- Month-end inventory spikes followed by return adjustments  
- Regional imbalance in stock distribution  
- Temporary revenue lift not supported by consumer demand  

**Root Structural Cause:**  
Incentive structure rewarded shipment volume rather than true demand fulfillment.

---

## Political & Behavioral Layer

Regional directors tied bonuses to revenue growth.  
Supply chain executed shipment requests without demand validation.  
No control metric tied to post-transfer sell-through validation.

---

## Executive Decision

Freeze non-velocity-based inter-branch transfers and redesign performance incentives to align revenue recognition with sell-through integrity.

---

## Trade-off Matrix

| Strategic Gain | Financial Sacrifice | Risk Created | Net Economic Effect |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| 14.2M SAR capital stabilization | Short-term revenue decline (-2.1%) | Regional dissatisfaction | Structural capital protection |

**Capital Logic:**  
Revenue inflation without cash realization creates negative working capital leverage and ROIC erosion.

---

## Counterfactual Scenario

Without intervention:

- Inventory growth exceeds sales growth by >7%  
- ROIC decline projected -1.3%  
- Financing exposure increase +2M SAR  
- Long-term credibility erosion  

---

## Defensibility Test

### CFO Challenge  
Does freezing transfers reduce reported performance?

**Response:**  
Correcting inflated metrics protects capital integrity and prevents structural cash distortion.

### CEO Challenge  
Will this demotivate regional teams?

**Response:**  
Incentives redesigned to reward sell-through velocity and inventory efficiency, not shipment volume.

---

## Execution Reality

- 9.6M SAR reversed transfers within 30 days  
- Incentive structure adjusted for next fiscal cycle  
- Inventory turnover restored to 6.3  
- Cash cycle normalized to 69 days  

---

## Financial Impact

Capital Recovered: 9.6M SAR  
Inventory Stabilized  
Cash Conversion Cycle Reduced: -6 days  
ROIC Stabilized Above 15%  

---

## Decision Ownership

Decision Owner: Head of Commercial Intelligence  
Financial Oversight: CFO  
Governance Oversight: Internal Audit  
Review Cycle: Monthly inventory divergence audit  

---

## Lessons Learned

1. Revenue without sell-through validation distorts capital.  
2. Incentive design shapes operational behavior.  
3. Channel stuffing creates artificial growth.  
4. Inventory divergence is an early fraud signal.  
5. Capital governance requires behavioral controls.

## Capital Logic Summary

Restoring sell-through integrity prevented capital distortion, protected ROIC, and reinforced ethical performance governance.
