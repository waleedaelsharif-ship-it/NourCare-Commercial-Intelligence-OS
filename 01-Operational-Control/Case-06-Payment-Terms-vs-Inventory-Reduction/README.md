# Case 06 — Payment Terms vs Inventory Reduction

---

## Executive Summary

Faced with liquidity pressure, NourCare evaluated extending supplier payment terms versus reducing inventory exposure. A structural inventory reduction strategy improved capital efficiency by 19.4M SAR and strengthened ROIC sustainability, avoiding long-term supplier dependency risk.

---

## Context

Quarter: Q2  
Season: Stable Demand  
Scope: National (48 branches)  
Liquidity Pressure: 30M SAR short-term funding gap  

Finance proposed negotiating extended payment terms. Commercial Intelligence proposed inventory reduction to structurally improve working capital.

---

## Baseline Financial Spine

Revenue: 1.22B SAR  
Inventory Value: 162M SAR  
Inventory Turnover: 6.2  
Cash Conversion Cycle: 71 days  
ROIC: 15.3%  
Supplier Concentration: Top 5 suppliers = 62% volume  
Cost of Capital: 9%

---

## Analytical Diagnosis

- Inventory buffer exceeded optimal level by 14%  
- Sales growth flat (+3.8%)  
- Working capital strain driven by excess category depth  
- Payment term extension would delay cash outflow but not reduce capital employed  

**Root Structural Cause:**  
Operational growth decisions were not synchronized with capital structure capacity.

---

## Political & Behavioral Layer

Finance prioritized liquidity smoothing.  
Procurement resisted inventory cuts due to rebate dependencies.  
Suppliers offered term extension conditional on higher volume commitment.

---

## Executive Decision

Reject volume-linked payment extension and reduce inventory by 15% across low-velocity segments to structurally improve capital discipline.

---

## Trade-off Matrix

| Strategic Gain | Financial Sacrifice | Risk Created | Net Economic Effect |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| 19.4M SAR capital release | Loss of 1.8M SAR rebate | 3% supplier tension risk | Structural ROIC improvement |

**Capital Logic:**  
Inventory reduction permanently lowers capital employed, while payment term extension merely shifts timing risk without improving return efficiency.

---

## Counterfactual Scenario

If payment extension chosen:

- Inventory remains inflated  
- Supplier dependency deepens  
- Future negotiation leverage weakened  
- ROIC improvement limited  

---

## Defensibility Test

### CFO Challenge  
Why refuse improved payment flexibility?

**Response:**  
Liquidity smoothing without capital reduction masks structural inefficiency. True improvement requires lowering invested capital.

### Supplier Challenge  
Will reduced volume impact partnership?

**Response:**  
Long-term sustainable purchasing volume depends on healthy capital cycle. Structural efficiency strengthens partnership credibility.

## Execution Reality

- Inventory reduction achieved across 1,900 SKUs  
- 14.7M SAR reduction within 8 weeks  
- Cash cycle improved by 7 days  
- Supplier negotiations stabilized post-adjustment  

---

## Financial Impact

Working Capital Released: 19.4M SAR  
Cash Conversion Cycle: 71 → 64 days  
ROIC Improvement: 15.3% → 16.2%  
Financing Exposure Reduced

## Decision Ownership

Decision Owner: Head of Commercial Intelligence  
Financial Oversight: CFO  
Procurement Alignment: Head of Procurement  
Review Cycle: Monthly capital allocation review  

---

## Lessons Learned

1. Liquidity smoothing is not capital efficiency.  
2. Supplier dependency increases systemic risk.  
3. Rebates rarely justify structural inefficiency.  
4. Inventory discipline strengthens negotiation leverage.  
5. Capital reduction is superior to payment deferral.

## Capital Logic Summary

Structural inventory correction delivered sustainable capital efficiency and reduced systemic supplier dependency risk.
