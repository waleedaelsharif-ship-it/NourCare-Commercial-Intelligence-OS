# Case 07 — Capital Market Shock (SAIBOR Exposure)

---

## Executive Summary

A sudden SAIBOR increase from 4.2% to 6.8% raised short-term financing cost by 2.6%, exposing 120M SAR in floating-rate working capital facilities. A rapid capital compression initiative reduced borrowing dependency by 27M SAR and protected 1.7M SAR in annual financing cost.

---

## Context

Quarter: Q3  
Season: Stable Demand  
Scope: National (48 branches)  
Exposure: 120M SAR short-term revolving credit facility (floating rate)  

Following a market-wide interest rate increase, NourCare faced rising financing costs directly impacting working capital funding.

---

## Baseline Financial Spine

Revenue: 1.25B SAR  
Inventory Value: 168M SAR  
Inventory Turnover: 6.3  
Cash Conversion Cycle: 69 days  
ROIC: 16.0%  
Floating Debt Exposure: 120M SAR  
Old Financing Rate: 4.2%  
New Financing Rate: 6.8%

---

## Analytical Diagnosis

- Working capital partially financed via short-term borrowing  
- Excess safety buffers in 4 non-core categories  
- Cash cycle still above internal benchmark (65 days)  
- Financing cost sensitivity not stress-tested in planning cycle  

**Root Structural Cause:**  
Capital structure vulnerability due to reliance on floating-rate funding without operational buffer flexibility.

---

## Political & Behavioral Layer

Finance initially proposed refinancing.  
Operations resisted inventory compression due to stability concerns.  
Board requested rapid exposure mitigation.

---

## Executive Decision

Launch a 90-day capital compression program to reduce inventory exposure by 12% and lower floating debt utilization.

---

## Trade-off Matrix

| Strategic Gain | Financial Sacrifice | Risk Created | Net Economic Effect |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| 27M SAR borrowing reduction | 1.1M SAR reduced promotional intensity | 2% short-term sales softness | +1.7M SAR annual financing protection |

**Capital Logic:**  
27M SAR × 6.8% = 1.84M SAR annual financing cost avoided, exceeding promotional trade-off impact.

---

## Counterfactual Scenario

Without action:

- Annual financing cost increase: +3.1M SAR  
- ROIC decline: -1.4%  
- Cash conversion cycle deterioration under stress  
- Increased refinancing risk  

---

## Defensibility Test

### CFO Challenge  
Why reduce inventory instead of refinancing at fixed rate?

**Response:**  
Refinancing shifts cost timing but maintains capital inefficiency. Structural capital compression reduces both exposure and risk.

### CEO Challenge  
Will capital compression affect growth?

**Response:**  
Compression targeted non-velocity SKUs. Core growth categories preserved.

## Execution Reality

- 15M SAR released via safety stock recalibration  
- 7M SAR via supplier return alignment  
- 5M SAR via SKU rationalization  
- Floating debt utilization reduced to 93M SAR  
- Cash cycle improved to 63 days  

---

## Financial Impact

Debt Reduction: 27M SAR  
Financing Cost Avoided: ~1.7M SAR annually  
ROIC Stabilized Above 16%  
Cash Conversion Cycle: 69 → 63 days

## Decision Ownership

Decision Owner: Head of Commercial Intelligence  
Financial Oversight: CFO  
Treasury Alignment: Finance Department  
Review Cycle: Quarterly capital stress test  

---

## Lessons Learned

1. Floating-rate exposure requires operational flexibility.  
2. Capital compression is superior to financial engineering alone.  
3. Interest rate risk must be stress-tested annually.  
4. Working capital structure determines resilience.  
5. ROIC must be protected under market volatility.

---

## Capital Logic Summary

Operational capital compression protected the organization from external financing shocks and reinforced structural resilience against market volatility.
