# Case 23 — SKU Rationalization for Contribution Density

---

## Executive Summary

An internal SKU audit revealed that 18% of SKUs generated less than 2% of total contribution while consuming 21M SAR in working capital. A structured SKU rationalization program improved contribution density and released non-productive capital.

---

## Context

Quarter: Q1  
Scope: National (48 branches)  
Total Active SKUs: 12,500  
Low-Contribution SKUs Identified: 2,250  
Capital at Risk: 21M SAR tied in low-density inventory  

SKU proliferation driven by supplier pressure and assortment expansion culture.

---

## Baseline Financial Spine

National Revenue: 1.28B SAR  
Blended Gross Margin: 27.3%  
Inventory Value: 184M SAR  
Inventory Turnover: 7.1  
ROIC: 19.4%  
Slow-Moving SKU Ratio: 17%

## Visual Insight

---

## Analytical Diagnosis

- Long-tail SKUs increased complexity and diluted shelf productivity  
- Contribution per SKU highly skewed (Pareto concentration)  
- 18% of SKUs negative or near-zero net contribution  
- Replenishment and logistics overhead inflated  

**Root Structural Cause:**  
Assortment growth not governed by contribution threshold.

---

## Political & Behavioral Layer

Category managers rewarded for assortment expansion.  
Suppliers incentivized SKU listing breadth.  
Operations burdened by inventory complexity.

---

## Executive Decision

Remove bottom 15% SKUs based on contribution density threshold and implement minimum contribution filter for new listings.

---

## Trade-off Matrix

| Strategic Gain | Financial Sacrifice | Risk Created | Net Economic Effect |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| 21M SAR capital release | 1.1% potential revenue reduction | Perceived assortment limitation | +Contribution density uplift |

**Capital Logic:**  
Capital tied in low-density SKUs generates opportunity cost exceeding marginal revenue contribution.

---

## Counterfactual Scenario

If SKU proliferation continued:

- Inventory complexity increases  
- Capital inefficiency accumulates  
- Shelf productivity declines  
- Cash cycle deteriorates  

---

## Defensibility Test

### CFO Challenge  
Will SKU reduction reduce revenue growth potential?

**Response:**  
Removed SKUs contribute minimal revenue and near-zero contribution. Capital redeployed to higher-density SKUs improves overall return.

### Marketing Challenge  
Will reduced variety harm customer perception?

**Response:**  
Core and high-velocity SKUs retained. Rationalization targets non-core tail items.

## Execution Reality

- 1,980 SKUs delisted  
- 19M SAR inventory reduction achieved  
- Inventory turnover improved to 7.6  
- Shelf productivity increased  

---

## Financial Impact

Capital Released: 19M SAR  
Contribution Density Improved  
ROIC: 19.4% → 20.6%  
Cash Conversion Cycle Reduced

## Decision Ownership

Decision Owner: Head of Commercial Intelligence  
Category Alignment: Category Directors  
Financial Oversight: CFO  
Review Cycle: Quarterly Contribution Audit  

---

## Lessons Learned

1. Assortment expansion must follow contribution logic.  
2. Long-tail SKUs dilute capital efficiency.  
3. Contribution density outperforms SKU count growth.  
4. Complexity carries hidden cost.  
5. Capital reallocation strengthens structural margin.

---

## Capital Logic Summary

Contribution-based SKU rationalization improved capital productivity, reduced complexity, and strengthened margin architecture across the network.
