# Case 26 — Gross Margin vs Net Contribution Illusion

---

## Executive Summary

A high-margin category (32% gross margin) appeared to outperform portfolio averages, yet logistics cost, return rate, and capital intensity reduced net contribution to below network average. Reframing performance measurement to net contribution improved capital allocation decisions and increased ROIC by 1.5%.

---

## Context

Quarter: Q2  
Category Focus: Imported Wellness Supplements  
Reported Gross Margin: 32%  
Perceived Performance: High  
Observed Issue: Weak capital return  

Gross margin reporting overstated economic performance.

---

## Baseline Financial Spine

Category Revenue: 210M SAR  
Gross Margin: 32%  
Logistics Premium: +4.5%  
Return Rate: 3.2%  
Inventory Coverage: 38 days  
Net Contribution (Adjusted): 24.6%  
ROIC (Category): 14.8%  
National ROIC: 19.2%

## Visual Insight

---

## Analytical Diagnosis

- Imported SKUs incurred higher transport and clearance costs  
- Higher return & expiry rates  
- Longer inventory holding period  
- Working capital intensity diluted actual return  

**Root Structural Cause:**  
Decision governance based on gross margin instead of full economic contribution.

---

## Political & Behavioral Layer

Category managers rewarded on gross margin ranking.  
Finance dashboards did not include logistics-adjusted contribution.  
Board reports emphasized gross margin headline.

---

## Executive Decision

Replace gross margin ranking with Net Contribution Index (NCI) incorporating logistics, returns, and capital cost.

---

## Trade-off Matrix

| Strategic Gain | Financial Sacrifice | Risk Created | Net Economic Effect |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| +1.5% network ROIC improvement | 0.8M SAR reporting system upgrade cost | Cultural resistance to metric change | Structural capital allocation accuracy |

**Capital Logic:**  
Net contribution reflects true economic return per invested SAR, correcting capital misallocation.

---

## Counterfactual Scenario

If gross margin metric maintained:

- Continued misallocation toward capital-heavy categories  
- Hidden ROIC erosion  
- Inventory intensity imbalance  
- Illusion of profitability  

---

## Defensibility Test

### CFO Challenge  
Why complicate reporting structure?

**Response:**  
Gross margin hides capital intensity. Net contribution aligns reporting with economic reality.

### Board Challenge  
Will metric change confuse stakeholders?

**Response:**  
NCI clarifies real return drivers and strengthens strategic capital allocation decisions.

---

## Execution Reality

- Net Contribution Index deployed across dashboard  
- Category ranking reordered  
- Capital reallocation toward higher NCI categories  
- Imported overstock reduced  

---

## Financial Impact

Category ROIC: 14.8% → 18.9%  
Network ROIC: 19.2% → 20.7%  
Capital Efficiency Improved  
Inventory Coverage Reduced  

---

## Decision Ownership

Decision Owner: Head of Commercial Intelligence  
Financial Oversight: CFO  
Reporting Governance: Executive Committee  
Review Cycle: Quarterly Contribution Audit  

---

## Lessons Learned

1. Gross margin is an incomplete performance metric.  
2. Capital intensity must be embedded in analysis.  
3. Logistics and returns distort contribution reality.  
4. Reporting structure shapes capital allocation.  
5. Economic truth > headline margin.

---

## Capital Logic Summary

Shifting from gross margin to net contribution eliminated profitability illusion, improved capital allocation precision, and strengthened network-wide ROIC.
