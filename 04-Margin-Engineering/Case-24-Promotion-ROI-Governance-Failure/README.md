# Case 24 — Promotion ROI Governance Failure

---

## Executive Summary

A large-scale multi-category promotional campaign increased revenue by 8.7% but failed to deliver incremental contribution, resulting in 6.3M SAR negative ROI impact. Governance restructuring introduced a pre-launch ROI simulation gate to prevent capital-destructive campaigns.

---

## Context

Quarter: Q3  
Campaign Scope: National (OTC + Supplements + Wellness)  
Campaign Duration: 4 Weeks  
Revenue Uplift: +8.7%  
Observed Issue: Contribution stagnation  

Campaign executed without structured ROI validation.

---

## Baseline Financial Spine

Campaign Revenue: +48M SAR uplift  
Promotion Cost: 21M SAR  
Blended Margin Pre-Campaign: 27.1%  
Blended Margin During Campaign: 24.4%  
ROIC Impact: -0.9%  
Inventory Turnover: 7.4

## Visual Insight

---

## Analytical Diagnosis

- 44% of uplift came from SKUs already trending upward  
- Incremental demand poorly isolated  
- Discount depth exceeded elasticity benefit  
- No ROI break-even threshold enforced  

**Root Structural Cause:**  
Revenue-driven campaign approval lacking incremental contribution modeling.

---

## Political & Behavioral Layer

Marketing prioritized competitive response.  
Regional managers focused on visible traffic uplift.  
Finance lacked authority to block campaigns.

---

## Executive Decision

Introduce mandatory pre-launch ROI simulation and incremental demand validation before campaign approval.

---

## Trade-off Matrix

| Strategic Gain | Financial Sacrifice | Risk Created | Net Economic Effect |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| Prevention of future 6M+ SAR negative ROI | 2–3% reduction in campaign frequency | Slower marketing response | Structural capital protection |

**Capital Logic:**  
Campaign approval must be based on incremental contribution, not revenue optics.

---

## Counterfactual Scenario

If governance unchanged:

- Margin volatility continues  
- Campaign dependency deepens  
- ROIC erosion accumulates  
- Marketing spend inefficiency persists  

---

## Defensibility Test

### CFO Challenge  
Why restrict marketing agility?

**Response:**  
Uncontrolled agility creates negative ROI. Governance ensures sustainable margin discipline.

### Marketing Challenge  
Will simulation delay campaign execution?

**Response:**  
Pre-built ROI templates reduce approval time while increasing financial confidence.

---

## Execution Reality

- ROI simulation template deployed  
- 32% of proposed campaigns rejected  
- Incremental contribution tracked monthly  
- Margin volatility reduced  

---

## Financial Impact

Future Negative ROI Avoided  
Gross Margin Stabilized  
ROIC Recovered to 20%+  
Marketing Spend Efficiency Improved  

---

## Decision Ownership

Decision Owner: Head of Commercial Intelligence  
Marketing Governance: Campaign Committee  
Financial Oversight: CFO  
Review Cycle: Campaign-by-Campaign Approval  

---

## Lessons Learned

1. Revenue uplift is not ROI.  
2. Discount depth must match elasticity.  
3. Incremental demand must be isolated.  
4. Governance protects contribution.  
5. Campaign discipline strengthens ROIC stability.

## Capital Logic Summary

Promotion governance restructuring prevented recurring capital destruction and aligned marketing execution with contribution-based decision logic.
