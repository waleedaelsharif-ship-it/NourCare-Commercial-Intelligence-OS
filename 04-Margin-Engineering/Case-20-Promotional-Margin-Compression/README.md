# Case 20 — Promotional Margin Compression

---

## Executive Summary

Excessive promotional intensity increased revenue by 6.4% but compressed gross margin by 2.3%, reducing net contribution and lowering ROIC by 1.1%. A promotion governance reset restored margin stability without sacrificing strategic volume.

---

## Context

Quarter: Q2  
Category Focus: OTC Wellness  
Promotional Share of Revenue: 29%  
National Gross Margin: 25.6% → 23.3%  

Aggressive discounting introduced to counter competitive pressure.

---

## Baseline Financial Spine

Revenue Growth: +6.4%  
Gross Margin Compression: -2.3%  
Promotion Cost: 18.4M SAR  
Inventory Turnover: 6.7  
ROIC: 16.8% → 15.7%  
Cash Conversion Cycle: 66 days

## Visual Insight

---

## Analytical Diagnosis

- 41% of promotional SKUs showed negative incremental margin  
- Volume uplift concentrated in low-contribution items  
- Basket size increased but contribution per basket declined  
- No ROI threshold applied before campaign launch  

**Root Structural Cause:**  
Promotion strategy driven by revenue optics rather than contribution analysis.

---

## Political & Behavioral Layer

Marketing focused on competitive response.  
Regional managers demanded visible campaigns.  
Finance flagged declining contribution but lacked enforcement mechanism.

---

## Executive Decision

Introduce Promotion ROI Gate: campaigns must demonstrate minimum 8% incremental contribution uplift before approval.

---

## Trade-off Matrix

| Strategic Gain | Financial Sacrifice | Risk Created | Net Economic Effect |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| +1.9% gross margin recovery | 3% reduction in promotional volume | Short-term revenue softness | Structural ROIC stabilization |

**Capital Logic:**  
Margin recovery improves contribution per invested inventory unit and protects long-term capital efficiency.

## Counterfactual Scenario

If promotion intensity maintained:

- Margin compression persists  
- ROIC declines further  
- Cash cycle strain increases  
- Dependency on discounting deepens  

---

## Defensibility Test

### CFO Challenge  
Why reduce promotional volume during competitive pressure?

**Response:**  
Unprofitable volume destroys capital. Contribution-positive volume protects sustainability.

### Marketing Challenge  
Will reduced promotion hurt brand visibility?

**Response:**  
ROI filter ensures strategic campaigns remain active while eliminating loss-making promotions.

## Execution Reality

- 37% of campaigns rejected under new ROI gate  
- Promotion share reduced to 21%  
- Margin recovered within 2 months  
- Inventory turnover stabilized  

---

## Financial Impact

Gross Margin: 23.3% → 25.2%  
ROIC: 15.7% → 16.9%  
Promotion Cost Reduction Achieved  
Contribution Stabilized

## Decision Ownership

Decision Owner: Head of Commercial Intelligence  
Marketing Alignment: Campaign Governance Committee  
Financial Oversight: CFO  
Review Cycle: Monthly Promotion ROI Review

## Lessons Learned

1. Revenue growth without contribution destroys capital.  
2. Promotion intensity must be governed.  
3. ROI gate protects structural margin.  
4. Basket growth is meaningless without contribution growth.  
5. Margin engineering requires discipline, not creativity alone.

## Capital Logic Summary

Promotion governance reset restored contribution stability, protected ROIC, and reduced structural dependency on discount-driven revenue.
