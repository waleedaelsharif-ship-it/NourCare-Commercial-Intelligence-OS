## Visual Insight

---

## Analytical Diagnosis

- High brand overlap with minimal differentiation  
- Private label price positioned 8–12% below leading brand  
- Consumer acceptance strong in essential OTC  
- Branded suppliers resisted shelf reallocation  

**Root Structural Cause:**  
Margin expansion opportunity suppressed by overreliance on branded suppliers.

---

## Political & Behavioral Layer

Brand suppliers pushed trade discounts to defend share.  
Category managers feared cannibalization backlash.  
Marketing required evidence of quality perception stability.

---

## Executive Decision

Increase private label shelf allocation in essential SKUs while maintaining brand presence in hero segments.

## Trade-off Matrix

| Strategic Gain | Financial Sacrifice | Risk Created | Net Economic Effect |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| +2.6% blended margin uplift | 1.4M SAR trade discount reduction | Supplier relationship tension | Structural contribution improvement |

**Capital Logic:**  
Higher contribution per unit improves return on inventory investment and reduces supplier dependency risk.

## Counterfactual Scenario

If private label share unchanged:

- Margin stagnation  
- Supplier leverage dominance  
- Limited pricing flexibility  
- Contribution plateau
