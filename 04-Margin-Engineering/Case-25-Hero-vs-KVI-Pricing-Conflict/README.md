# Case 25 — Hero vs KVI Pricing Conflict

---

## Executive Summary

Price pressure on Key Value Items (KVI) triggered a broad discount reaction affecting Hero SKUs, compressing blended gross margin by 1.7%. A differentiated pricing architecture restored margin discipline while preserving competitive price perception.

---

## Context

Quarter: Q4  
Category Focus: Chronic Care & OTC Essentials  
Competitive Pressure: Aggressive KVI price cuts  
Observed Reaction: Cross-category discounting  

Retail pricing strategy blurred distinction between traffic drivers and margin drivers.

---

## Baseline Financial Spine

Blended Gross Margin: 27.4% → 25.7%  
KVI Price Reduction: -5%  
Hero SKU Discount Depth: -4%  
Revenue Growth: +3.2%  
ROIC Impact: -1.2%  
Inventory Turnover: 7.6

## Visual Insight

---

## Analytical Diagnosis

- 60% of traffic influenced by 8 core KVI SKUs  
- Hero SKUs carried 38% of contribution  
- Blanket discount strategy eroded high-contribution items  
- Elasticity for Hero SKUs significantly lower than KVI  

**Root Structural Cause:**  
Failure to segment pricing architecture between traffic-driving SKUs and margin-driving SKUs.

---

## Political & Behavioral Layer

Regional managers reacted to competitor pricing emotionally.  
Marketing pushed price-matching campaigns.  
Finance observed margin erosion without clear SKU segmentation.

---

## Executive Decision

Isolate KVI pricing strategy and maintain margin integrity on Hero SKUs through segmented price governance.

---

## Trade-off Matrix

| Strategic Gain | Financial Sacrifice | Risk Created | Net Economic Effect |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| +1.7% margin recovery | 0.9% traffic reduction risk | Competitive perception sensitivity | Structural contribution stabilization |

**Capital Logic:**  
Protecting Hero SKU margin preserves contribution density and improves capital return per unit.

---

## Counterfactual Scenario

If blanket discounting maintained:

- Contribution erosion continues  
- ROIC declines further  
- Brand premium positioning weakened  
- Margin compression accelerates  

---

## Defensibility Test

### CFO Challenge  
Why not match competitor pricing fully?

**Response:**  
Price matching on non-elastic Hero SKUs destroys contribution without meaningful volume gain.

### Marketing Challenge  
Will KVI isolation harm competitive perception?

**Response:**  
KVI maintained competitively. Hero SKUs priced based on contribution elasticity.

## Execution Reality

- 12 KVI SKUs competitively repositioned  
- Hero SKU discounts removed  
- Margin recovered within 6 weeks  
- Traffic stabilized after initial adjustment  

---

## Financial Impact

Gross Margin: 25.7% → 27.4%  
ROIC: +1.3% recovery  
Contribution Stabilized  
Inventory Efficiency Maintained

## Decision Ownership

Decision Owner: Head of Commercial Intelligence  
Pricing Governance: Central Pricing Committee  
Financial Oversight: CFO  
Review Cycle: Monthly Pricing Elasticity Audit  

---

## Lessons Learned

1. Traffic drivers differ from margin drivers.  
2. Elasticity segmentation protects contribution.  
3. Blanket discounting destroys capital efficiency.  
4. Pricing architecture must be structured.  
5. Contribution > volume illusion.

## Capital Logic Summary

Segmented Hero vs KVI pricing restored margin discipline, preserved contribution density, and stabilized capital efficiency under competitive pressure.
