# Case 22 — Supplier Mix Rebalancing

---

## Executive Summary

Overconcentration among top suppliers (61% volume share) limited negotiation leverage and suppressed margin expansion. A structured supplier mix rebalance improved blended gross margin by 1.9% and reduced concentration risk without disrupting supply continuity.

---

## Context

Quarter: Q4  
Category Scope: OTC & Supplements  
Top 5 Supplier Share: 61%  
Blended Gross Margin: 25.4%  
Supplier Dependency Risk Identified  

Heavy reliance on dominant suppliers restricted pricing flexibility.

---

## Baseline Financial Spine

Annual Category Revenue: 380M SAR  
Top Supplier Average Margin: 22%  
Alternative Supplier Margin: 27–30%  
Inventory Turnover: 6.9  
ROIC: 18.2%  
Supplier Concentration Index (Top 5): 61%

## Visual Insight

---

## Analytical Diagnosis

- Limited competitive bidding pressure  
- Trade discount structure tied to volume commitment  
- Low adoption of secondary suppliers  
- Margin gap of 4–6% in selected SKUs  

**Root Structural Cause:**  
Negotiation power imbalance due to high supplier concentration.

---

## Political & Behavioral Layer

Procurement favored established supplier relationships.  
Category managers concerned about quality consistency.  
Suppliers leveraged volume dependency in negotiation cycles.

---

## Executive Decision

Reduce top supplier share from 61% to 48% through phased secondary supplier onboarding in margin-sensitive SKUs.

---

## Trade-off Matrix

| Strategic Gain | Financial Sacrifice | Risk Created | Net Economic Effect |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| +1.9% blended margin uplift | 0.9M SAR onboarding & qualification cost | Transitional supply risk | Structural negotiation leverage improvement |

**Capital Logic:**  
Margin expansion and risk diversification increase contribution density and reduce systemic supply exposure.

---

## Counterfactual Scenario

If supplier concentration maintained:

- Margin ceiling persists  
- Limited negotiation leverage  
- Higher systemic supply risk  
- Capital inefficiency embedded  

---

## Defensibility Test

### CFO Challenge  
Why incur onboarding cost for marginal margin improvement?

**Response:**  
Blended margin uplift across 380M SAR revenue materially increases contribution and ROIC.

### Procurement Challenge  
Will supplier diversification reduce rebate power?

**Response:**  
Rebate dependency replaced by structural margin improvement and leverage balance.

---

## Execution Reality

- Secondary suppliers onboarded across 240 SKUs  
- Top supplier share reduced to 49%  
- Margin improvement realized within 2 quarters  
- No material supply disruption observed  

---

## Financial Impact

Blended Margin: +1.9%  
Supplier Concentration Reduced  
ROIC: 18.2% → 19.4%  
Contribution per SKU Increased
