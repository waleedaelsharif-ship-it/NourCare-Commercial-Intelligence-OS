# Cluster 04 — Margin Engineering

---

## Strategic Intent

This cluster focuses on margin structure optimization, promotional discipline, supplier mix governance, and contribution engineering.

Primary Objective: Increase contribution per invested SAR without relying on revenue inflation.

---

## Core Risk Themes

- Promotion-driven margin erosion
- Over-discounting for volume illusion
- Private label underutilization
- Supplier concentration distortion
- Hero SKU overexposure
- KVI mispricing
- Contribution misallocation

---

## Margin Philosophy

Revenue growth without contribution growth destroys capital.

Margin engineering must answer:

- Does this improve contribution per SKU?
- Does this protect or enhance ROIC?
- Does this reduce structural discount dependency?

---

## Governance Model

Decision Owner: Head of Commercial Intelligence  
Category Alignment: Category Directors  
Financial Oversight: CFO  
Review Cycle: Monthly Margin Performance Audit  

Escalation Trigger:  
If promotional intensity exceeds 22% of category revenue for 2 consecutive months, executive review is required.

## Strategic Note

It is structural contribution optimization aligned with capital efficiency.
