## Strategic Challenge

Despite revenue growth, capital efficiency showed signs of structural weakness:

- Dead stock accumulation
- Inventory-sales divergence
- Supplier dependency concentration
- Regional profitability imbalance

The Commercial Intelligence Operating System (CIOS) was developed to:

1. Protect Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)
2. Stabilize working capital
3. Enforce decision defensibility
4. Introduce governance discipline
5. Transition from sales-driven culture to capital-efficiency culture
